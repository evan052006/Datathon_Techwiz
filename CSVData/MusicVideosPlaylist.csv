-- | LYRICS |--

The club isn’t the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go 
Me and my friends at the table doing shots drinking fast and then we talk slow
you come over and start up a conversation with just me and trust me I’ll give it a chance now
Take my hand stop, put van the man on the jukebox and then we start to dance
And now I’m singing like

Girl you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now follow my lead
I may be crazy don’t mind me 
Say boy let’s not talk too much 
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now follow my lead
Come come on now follow my lead

I’m in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I’m in love with your body
Last night you were in my room 
And now my bed sheets smell like you 
Every day discovering something brand new
I’m in love with your body

Oh I X 4
I’m in love with your body
Oh I X 4
I’m in love with your body
Oh I X 4
I’m in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I’m in love with the shape of you 

One week in we let the story begin
We’re going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty
So go all you can eat 
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family’s doing ok
leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play
and I'm singing like

Girl you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now follow my lead 
I may be crazy, don’t mind me
Say boy let’s not talk too much 
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now follow my lead
Come come on now follow my lead

I’m in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I’m in love with your body
Last night you were in my room 
And now my bed sheets smell like you 
Every day discovering something brand new

Well I’m in love with your body
Oh I x 4 
I’m in love with your body
Oh I x 4
I’m in love with your body
Oh I X 4
I’m in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I’m in love with the shape of you 

Come on be my baby come on X 8

I’m in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I’m in love with your body
Last night you were in my room 
And now my bed sheets smell like you 
Every day discovering something brand new

Well I’m in love with your body
Come on be my baby come on X 6
Every day discovering something brand new
I’m in love with the shape of you 
 
About Ed Sheeran: 
Ed Sheeran may be the quintessential pop star of the 2010s: an internationally acclaimed, multi-award winning singer/songwriter who seems to acknowledge no boundaries between styles or eras with elements of folk, hip-hop, pop, dance, soul, and rock woven throughout his music. 

His incredible catalogue includes the studio albums ‘+’ (plus), ‘x’ (multiply) and ‘÷’ (divide) which spawned hit singles such as ‘The A team’ , ’Lego House’, ‘Sing', ‘Thinking Out Loud’, ‘Photograph’, ‘Shape Of You’, ‘Castle on The Hill’ and ‘Perfect’. 
 
In 2019, Ed Sheeran released the genre-spanning ‘No.6 Collaborations Project’ which featured a wide-range of artists including ‘Justin Bieber’, ‘Camilla’ Cabello’, ‘Travis Scott’, ‘Eminem’, ‘Cardi B, ‘Paulo Londra’, ‘Bruno Mars’ and ‘Stormzy’ amongst many others, producing hits such as ‘I Don’t Care’, ‘Beautiful People’, ‘South of The Border’ and ‘Take Me Back To London’.

Lyrics: Sorry – Justin Bieber
 
You gotta go and get 
Angry at all of my honesty
You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies 
I hope I don't run out of Time could someone call the referee
Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness 
 
I know you know that I 
made those mistakes maybe once or twice 
And by once or twice I Mean 
Maybe a couple a hundred times 
So let me oh let me 
Redeem oh redeem oh my self tonight 
Cause I just need one more shot at second chances 
 
Yeah
Is it too late now to say sorry 
Cause I’m missing more than just your body 
Is it too late now to say sorry 
Yeah I know that I let you down 
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now 
I’m sorry yeah
Sorry yeah
Sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I’m sorry now
 
I'll take every single piece of the blame 
If you want me too 
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
I'll go I'll go and then 
You go you go out and spill the truth 
Can we both say the words and forget this 
 
Yeah
Is it too late now to say sorry 
Cause I’m missing more than just your body 
Is it too late now to say sorry 
Yeah I know that I let you down 
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now 
 
I'm not just trying to get you back on me
Cause I’m missing more than just your body 
Is it too late now to say sorry 
Yeah I know that I let you down 
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now 
 
I’m sorry (yeah)
Sorry (oh)
Sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down 
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now 
 
I’m sorry (yeah)

""Let Her Go"" [Lyrics]

Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go

Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow and they go so fast

You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies

But you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old empty feeling in your heart
'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast

Well you see her when you fall asleep
But never to touch and never to keep
'Cause you loved her too much
And you dived too deep

Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

And you let her go
And you let her go
Well you let her go

'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

And you let her go

Lyrics:
You were the shadow of my light
Did you feel us
Another start
You fade away
Afraid our aim is out of sight
Wanna see us
Alive
Where are you now
Where are you now
Where are you now
Was it all in my fantasy
Where are you now
Were you only imaginary
Where are you now
Atlantis
Under the sea
Under the sea
Where are you now
Another dream
The monsters running wild inside of me
I'm faded
I'm faded
So lost
I'm faded
I'm faded
So lost
I'm faded
These shallow waters, never met
What I needed
I'm letting go
A deeper dive
Eternal silence of the sea
I'm breathing
Alive
Where are you now
Where are you now
Under the bright
But faded lights
You set my heart on fire
Where are you now
Where are you now
Where are you now
Atlantis
Under the sea
Under the sea
Where are you now
Another dream
The monsters running wild inside of me
I'm faded
I'm faded
So lost
I'm faded
I'm faded
So lost
I'm faded

Chorus:
So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang
I was told when I get older, all my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure, and I care what people think

My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our mama sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out (oh)
Wish we could turn back time (oh) to the good old days (oh)
When our mama sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
We're stressed out

Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's coming from?
I'd make a candle out of it if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell, out of it, I'd probably only sell one
It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and tree house homes, we all would take the latter

My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our mama sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out (oh)
Wish we could turn back time (oh) to the good old days (oh)
When our mama sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out

Used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship, and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face
Sayin', ""Wake up, you need to make money, "" yeah

We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship, and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face
Saying, ""Wake up, you need to make money, "" yeah

Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our mama sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out (oh)
Wish we could turn back time (oh) to the good old days (oh)
When our mama sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out

We used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
Used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
Used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship, and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face
Saying, ""Wake up, you need to make money, "" yeah

LYRICS
Today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything.

Uh!
I'm gonna kick my feet up
Then stare at the fan
Turn the TV on, throw my hand in my pants
Nobody's gonna tell me I can't

I'll be lounging on the couch,
Just chillin' in my snuggie
Click to MTV, so they can teach me how to dougie
'Cause in my castle I'm the freaking man

Oh, yes I said it
I said it
I said it 'cause I can

Today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything

Nothing at all!
Ooh, hoo, ooh, hoo, ooh, ooh-ooh
Nothing at all
Ooh, hoo, ooh, hoo, ooh, ooh-ooh

Tomorrow I'll wake up, do some P90X
Meet a really nice girl, have some really nice sex
And she's gonna scream out: 'This is Great' (Oh my God, this is great)
Yeah

I might mess around, get my college degree
I bet my old man will be so proud of me
But sorry pops, you'll just have to wait
Haha

Oh, yes I said it
I said it
I said it 'cause I can

Today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything

No, I ain't gonna comb my hair
'Cause I ain't going anywhere
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
I'll just strut in my birthday suit
And let everything hang loose
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Ooh
Today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything

Nothing at all
Nothing at all
Nothing at all

#MeghanTrainor #AllAboutThatBass #Pop

Lyrics:

[Chorus]
Because you know I'm all about that bass
'Bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass

[Verse 1]
Yeah, it's pretty clear, I ain't no size two
But I can shake it, shake it, like I'm supposed to do
'Cause I got that boom boom that all the boys chase
And all the right junk in all the right places
I see the magazines working that Photoshop
We know that shit ain't real, come on now, make it stop
If you got beauty beauty just raise 'em up
'Cause every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the top

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, my momma she told me don't worry about your size
She says, boys like a little more booty to hold at night
(That booty, booty, uh, that booty booty)
You know I won't be no stick-figure, silicone Barbie doll
So, if that's what's you're into then go ahead and move along

[Chorus]
Because you know I'm all about that bass
'Bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass

[Verse 2]
Hey, I'm bringing booty back
Go ahead and tell them skinny bitches that
No, I'm just playing I know you think you're fat
But I'm here to tell you
Every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the top

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, my momma she told me don't worry about your size
She says, boys like a little more booty to hold at night
(That booty, booty, uh, that booty booty)
You know I won't be no stick-figure, silicone Barbie doll
So, if that's what's you're into then go ahead and move along


[Chorus]
Because you know I'm all about that bass
'Bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass
Because you know I'm all about that bass
'Bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble

Lyrics:
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
Don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

Can't you see that you're smothering me
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control?
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart right in front of you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
And every second I waste is more than I can take

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

And I know
I may end up failing too
But I know
You were just like me with someone disappointed in you

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
(I'm tired of being what you want me to be)
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
(I'm tired of being what you want me to be)

The a-ha YouTube channel is proud to host the music videos from these hits alongside live performance videos, lyric videos, and the solo work of band members Morten Harket (lead vocals), Paul Waaktaar-Savoy (Guitar), and Magne Furuholmen (Keyboards).",a-ha,A-Ha Take On Me 80's a-ha band take on me take on me take on me lyrics take on me a-ha take on me deadpool 2 scene 80s music 80s hits 80s music hits aha best songs 80s best songs of 80s 80s music mix 80s 80s music greatest hits 80s music classics best of 80s music aha lyrics 4 non blondes what;s up toto 4 non blondes clasicos de los 80 exitos de los 80 pop de los 80 take on me subtitulado take on me remastered take on me 4k take on me 1 billion,Music,244

Lyrics

I'm only human
I'm only, I'm only
I'm only human, human

Maybe I'm foolish
Maybe I'm blind
Thinking I can see through this
And see what's behind
Got no way to prove it
So maybe I'm blind
But I'm only human after all
I'm only human after all
Don't put your blame on me
Don't put your blame on me

Take a look in the mirror
And what do you see
Do you see it clearer
Or are you deceived
In what you believe
'Cause I'm only human after all
You're only human after all
Don't put the blame on me
Don't put your blame on me

Some people got the real problems
Some people out of luck
Some people think I can solve them
Lord heavens above
I'm only human after all
I'm only human after all
Don't put the blame on me
Don't put the blame on me

Don't ask my opinion
Don't ask me to lie
Then beg for forgiveness
For making you cry
Making you cry
'Cause I'm only human after all
I'm only human after all
Don't put your blame on me
Don't put the blame on me

Oh, some people got the real problems
Some people out of luck
Some people think I can solve them
Lord heavens above
I'm only human after all
I'm only human after all
Don't put the blame on me
Don't put the blame on me

I'm only human
I make mistakes
I'm only human
That's all it takes
To put the blame on me
Don't put the blame on me

I'm no prophet or Messiah
Should go looking somewhere higher

I'm only human after all
I'm only human after all
Don't put the blame on me
Don't put the blame on me

I'm only human
I do what I can
I'm just a man
I do what I can
Don't put the blame on me
Don't put your blame on me

Lyrics:
It starts with one thing
I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me

Will eventually be a memory of a time when
I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

Lyrics:
[Verse 1: Coolio]
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left
‘Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long
That even my momma thinks that my mind is gone
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You better watch how you talkin' and where you walkin'
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip, but I gotta loc
As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke
Fool, I'm the kinda G that little homies wanna be like
On my knees in the night, sayin' prayers in the street light
[Hook 1: LV]
Been spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Been spending most their lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
We keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
We keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
[Verse 2: Coolio]
Look at the situation they got me facin'
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the street
So I gotta be down with the hood team
Too much television watching, got me chasing dreams
I'm a educated fool with money on my mind
Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye
I'm a loc'd out gangsta, set trippin' banger
And my homies are down, so don't arouse my anger
Fool, death ain't nothin' but a heart beat away
I'm livin' life do or die, what can I say?
I'm 23 now, will I live to see 24?
The way things is going I don't know
[Hook 2: LV]
Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me?
[Hook 1]
Been spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Been spending most their lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
We keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
We keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
[Verse 3: Coolio]
Power and the money, money and the power
Minute after minute, hour after hour
Everybody's running, but half of them ain't lookin'
It's going on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cookin'
They say I gotta learn, but nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?
I guess they can't, I guess they won't
I guess they front; that's why I know my life is out of luck, fool!
[Hook 1]
Been spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Been spending most their lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
We keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
We keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
[Hook 2]
Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me?
Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me?

Lyrics:
We’re no strangers to love
You know the rules and so do I
A full commitment’s what I’m thinking of
You wouldn’t get this from any other guy

I just wanna tell you how I’m feeling
Gotta make you understand

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

We’ve known each other for so long
Your heart’s been aching but you’re too shy to say it
Inside we both know what’s been going on
We know the game and we’re gonna play it

And if you ask me how I’m feeling
Don’t tell me you’re too blind to see

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

LYRICS

I just want to stay in the sun where I find,
I know it’s hard sometimes,
Pieces of peace in the sun’s peace of mind,
I know it’s hard sometimes,
Yeah I think about the end just way too much,
But it’s fun to fantasize,
On my enemies I wouldn't wish who I was,
But it’s fun to fantasize.

I’m falling so I’m taking my time on my ride,
I’m falling so I’m taking my time on my ride.

“I’d die for you,” that’s easy to say,
We have a list of people that we would take,
A bullet for them, a bullet for you,
A bullet for everybody in this room,
But I don’t seem to see many bullets coming through,
See many bullets coming through,
Metaphorically I’m the man,
But literally I don’t know what I’d do,
“I’d live for you” and that’s hard to do,
Even harder to say when you know it’s not true,
Even harder to write when you know that tonight,
There were people back home who tried talking to you,
But then you ignored them still,
All these questions they’re for real,
Like who would you live for? Who would you die for?
And would you ever kill?

I’m falling so I’m taking my time on my ride,
I’m falling so I’m taking my time on my ride.
I’ve been thinking too much,
Help me.

I’m falling so I’m taking my time on my ride,
I’m falling so I’m taking my time on my ride.

I’ve been thinking too much,
Help me.

Lyrics:
Do you ever feel
Like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind
Wanting to start again
Do you ever feel
Feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards
One blow from caving in
Do you ever feel
Already buried deep
Six feet under
Screams but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there’s
Still a chance for you
‘Cause there’s a spark in you

You just gotta
Ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

‘Cause baby, you’re a firework
Come on show them what you’re worth
Make them go, “Oh, oh, oh”
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you’re a firework
Come on let your colors burst
Make them go, “Oh, oh, oh”
You’re gonna leave before they know

You don’t have to feel
Like a waste of space
You’re original
Cannot be replaced
If you only knew
What the future holds
After a hurricane
Comes a rainbow
Maybe the reason why
All the doors are closed
So you could open one
That leads you to the perfect …
Like a lightning bolt
Your heart will glow
And when it’s time you know

You just gotta
Ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

‘Cause baby, you’re a firework
Come on show them what you’re worth
Make them go, “Oh, oh, oh”
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you’re a firework
Come on let your colors burst
Make them go, “Oh, oh, oh”
You’re gonna leave before they know

Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
It’s always been inside of you, you, you
And now it’s time to let it through

‘Cause baby, you’re a firework
Come on show them what you’re worth
Make them go, “Oh, oh, oh”
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you’re a firework
Come on let your colors burst
Make them go, “Oh, oh, oh”
You’re gonna leave before they know

Hide the scars to fade away the shake-up (hide the scars to fade away the-)
Why'd you leave the keys upon the table?
Here you go create another fable, you wanted to
Grab a brush and put a little make-up, you wanted to
Hide the scars to fade away the shake-up, you wanted to
Why'd you leave the keys upon the table? You wanted to
I don't think you trust
In my self-righteous suicide
I cry when angels deserve to die
Wake up (wake up)
Grab a brush and put a little make-up
Hide the scars to fade away the (hide the scars to fade away the shake-up)
Why'd you leave the keys upon the table?
Here you go create another fable, you wanted to
Grab a brush and put a little make-up, you wanted to
Hide the scars to fade away the shake-up, you wanted to
Why'd you leave the keys upon the table? You wanted to

I cry when angels deserve to die
In my self-righteous suicide
I cry when angels deserve to die
Father (father)
Father (father)

Father (father)
Father, into your hands I commend my spirit
Father, into your hands
Why have you forsaken me?
In your eyes forsaken me
In your thoughts forsaken me
In your heart forsaken me, oh
Trust in my self-righteous suicide
I cry when angels deserve to die
In my self-righteous suicide
I cry when angels deserve to die

Evanescence are celebrating the 20th anniversary of Fallen with a series of special reissues via Craft Recordings. 

Details/order: https://found.ee/fallen20 

Available on Deluxe 2-LP, 2-CD, and Digital — as well as a Super Deluxe Edition collector’s box set — Fallen (20th Anniversary Edition) offers newly remastered audio, including the album’s singles “My Immortal,” “Going Under,” “Everybody’s Fool,” and “Bring Me To Life.” The expanded set also includes a trove of bonus material – ten tracks in all – comprising previously-unreleased demos and live recordings plus a selection of rare B-sides. Alongside reimagined artwork, all physical formats will include previously-unseen photos from the era, plus a handwritten foreword by Amy Lee, who oversaw all aspects of the reissue. The Deluxe vinyl, CD and digital configurations are out now. 

Available exclusively at Evanescence.com is the Super Deluxe Box Set, arriving February, 2024. Housed in a collectible shadow box-style package (inspired by Amy’s songwriting journal cover art), this limited edition includes all of the above-mentioned music as part of a 2-LP set (featuring a Black & Silver blend vinyl) plus a bonus cassette of previously unreleased demos and voice notes which is exclusive to this box set. Adding additional insight into the album is an expansive book which features new track-by-track notes from Lee, while a zoetropic turntable slipmat, rare photo prints, and enamel pin set round out the collection.

Lyrics:
Ayo, Jason
(Oh yeah!)
Say somethin' to her, holla at her
Haha, I got one question
Haha, how do you fit, all that, in them jeans? Hahaha
You know what to do with that big fat butt

Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Just a little bit (Swing!)

Patty cake, patty cake, with no hands
Got me in this club, making wedding plans
If I take pictures while you do your dance (do your dance)
I could make you famous on Instagram

Hot damn it (Woo!), your booty like two planets (Woo!)
Go ahead and go ham sandwich (Woo!)
Woah, I can't stand it
'Cause you know what to do with that big fat butt

Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Just a little bit (Swing!)

Cadillac Cadillac, pop that trunk
Let's take a shot, alley oop that donk
Tired of working that nine to five
Well, baby, let me come and change your life

Hot damn it (Woo!), your booty like two planets (Woo!)
Go ahead and go ham sandwich (Woo!)
Woah, I can't stand it
'Cause you know what to do with that big fat butt (Oh yeah)

Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle (Wiggle wiggle wiggle)
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle (Shake it, shake it, girl)
Just a little bit (Little bit, little bit, little bit) (Swing!)

Shake what your mamma gave you, misbehave you
I just wanna strip you, dip you, flip you, bubble bathe you
What they do, taste my raindrops, k boo?
Now what you're willing, what you wanting, what you may do
Completely separated 'til I deeply penetrate it
Then I take it out and wipe it off, eat it, ate it, love it, hate it
Overstated, underrated, everywhere I been
Can you wiggle wiggle for the D-O-double G again?

Come on, baby, turn around (turn around, turn around, turn around, yeah)
You're a star, girl, take a bow (take a bow, take a bow, take a bow, haha, yeah)
It's just one thing that's killing me
How do you fit that in them jeans?
You know what to do with that big fat butt

Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle (Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle)
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle (Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle)
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle (Shake it, shake it, girl)
Just a little bit (Little bit, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle) (Oh, woah!)

Now make it clap (Wiggle, wiggle wiggle)
Now make it clap (Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle)
Now make it clap
Love it when you do it like that
With no hands, baby, make it clap

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
And all I am is a man
I want the world in my hands
I hate the beach but I stand
In California with my toes in the sand
Use the sleeves of my sweater
Let's have an adventure
Head in the clouds but my gravity's centered
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
You in those little high waisted shorts, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
She knows what I think about
And what I think about
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no

[Chorus]
'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

[Verse 2]
And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides a mind
To move to a place so far away
The goosebumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue
'Cause you love the taste, yeah
These hearts adore
Everyone the other beats hardest for
Inside this place is warm
Outside it starts to pour

[Pre-Chorus]
Comin' down
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about
No, no, no

[Chorus]
'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater, woah

[Bridge]
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah

[Chorus]
'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
'Cause it's too cold for you here
Now, let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

[Outro]

Lyrics: 
I walk a lonely road
The only one that I have ever known
Don't know where it goes
But it's home to me, and I walk alone
I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one, and I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a-

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone

Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah

I'm walking down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the borderline
Of the edge and where I walk alone
Read between the lines
What's fucked up, and everything's all right
Check my vital signs
To know I'm still alive, and I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a-

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone

Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
I walk alone, I walk a-

I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one, and I walk a-

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone

Lyrics:
I'm gonna fight 'em off
A seven nation army couldn't hold me back
They're gonna rip it off
Taking their time right behind my back
And I'm talking to myself at night
Because I can't forget
Back and forth through my mind
Behind a cigarette

And the message coming from my eyes
Says ""Leave it alone""

Don't want to hear about it
Every single one's got a story to tell
Everyone knows about it
From the Queen of England to the Hounds of Hell
And if I catch it coming back my way
I'm gonna serve it to you
And that ain't what you want to hear
But that's what I'll do

And the feeling coming from my bones
Says ""Find a home""

I'm going to Wichita
Far from this opera forevermore
I'm gonna work the straw
Make the sweat drip out of every pore
And I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding
Right before the Lord
All the words are gonna bleed from me
And I will sing no more

And the stains coming from my blood
Tell me ""Go back home""

Lyrics:
I remembered black skies
The lightning all around me
I remembered each flash
As time began to blur
Like a startling sign
That fate had finally found me
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve

So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross
The distance in your eyes
Give me reason
To fill this hole
Connect this space between
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies
Across this new divide

There was nothing in sight
But memories left abandoned
There was nowhere to hide
The ashes fell like snow
And the ground caved in
Between where we were standing
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve

So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross
The distance in your eyes
Across this new divide

In every loss in every lie
In every truth that you deny
And each regret and each goodbye
Was a mistake too great to hide
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve

So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross
The distance in your eyes
Give me reason
To fill this hole
Connect this space between
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies
Across this new divide
Across this new divide
Across this new divide

Lyrics:
Ever wonder 'bout what he's doin'?
How it all turned to lies?
Sometimes I think that it's better
To never ask why
Where there is desire, there is gonna be a flame
Where there is a flame, someone's bound to get burned
But just because it burns doesn't mean you're gonna die
You've gotta get up and try, try, try
Gotta get up and try, try, try
Gotta get up and try, try, try
Funny how the heart can be deceiving
More than just a couple times
Why do we fall in love so easy
Even when it's not right?
Where there is desire, there is gonna be a flame
Where there is a flame, someone's bound to get burned
But just because it burns doesn't mean you're gonna die
You've gotta get up and try, try, try
Gotta get up and try, try, try
You've gotta get up and try, try, try
Ever worry that it might be ruined
And does it make you wanna cry?
When you're out there doing what you're doing
Are you just getting by?
Tell me, are you just getting by, by, by?
Where there is desire, there is gonna be a flame
Where there is a flame, someone's bound to get burned
But just because it burns doesn't mean you're gonna die
You've gotta get up and try, try, try
Gotta get up and try, try, try
You've gotta get up and try, try, try
Gotta get up and try, try, try
Gotta get up and try, try, try
You've gotta get up and try, try, try
Gotta get up and try, try, try

LYRICS
I did my time and I want out
So effusive - fade - it doesn't cut
The soul is not so vibrant
The reckoning, the sickening
Packaging subversion
Pseudo sacrosanct perversion
Go drill your deserts, go dig your graves
Then fill your mouth with all the money you will save
Sinking in, getting smaller again
I'm done! It has begun! I'm not the only one!

And the rain will kill us all...
Throw ourselves against the wall
But no one else can see
The preservation of the martyr in me

Psychosocial!

There are cracks in the road we laid
But where the temple fell
The secrets have gone mad
This is nothing new, but when we killed it all
The hate was all we had
Who needs another mess?
We could start over
Just look me in the eyes and say I'm wrong
Now there's only emptiness
Venomous, insipid
I think we're done. I'm not the only one!

Psychosocial!

THE LIMITS OF THE DEAD!

Fake anti-fascist lie - (psychosocial!)
I tried to tell you but - (psychosocial!)
Your purple hearts are giving out - (psychosocial!)
Can't stop a killing idea - (psychosocial!)
If it's hunting season - (psychosocial!)
Is this what you want? - (psychosocial!)
I'm not the only one!

Ladies and gentlemen

This is Mambo number 5



One, two, three, four, five

Everybody in the car so come let′s ride

To the liquor store around the corner

The boys say they want some gin and juice

But I really don't wanna



Beer bust like I had last week

I must stay deep ′cause talk is a cheap

I like Angela, Pamela, Sandra and Rita

And as I continue you know they're getting sweeter



So what can I do I really beg you my Lord

To me flirtin' is just like a sport

Anything fly is all good let me dump it

Please set in the trumpet



A little bit of Monica in my life

A little bit of Erica by my side

A little bit of Rita is all I need

A little bit of Tina is what I see



A little bit of Sandra in the sun

A little bit of Mary all night long

A little bit of Jessica here I am

A little bit of you makes me your man



Mambo number 5



Jump up and down and move it all around

Shake your head to the sound

Put your hands on the ground

Take one step left and one step right

One to the front and one to the side

Clap your hands once and clap your hands twice

And if it looks like this then you doin it right



A little bit of Monica in my life

A little bit of Erica by my side

A little bit of Rita is all I need

A little bit of Tina is what I see



A little bit of Sandra in the sun

A little bit of Mary all night long

A little bit of Jessica here I am

A little bit of you makes me your man



Trumpet, the trumpet 

Mambo number 5



A little bit of Monica in my life

A little bit of Erica by my side

A little bit of Rita is all I need

A little bit of Tina is what I see

A little bit of Sandra in the sun

A little bit of Mary all night long

A little bit of Jessica here I am

A little bit of you makes me your man



I do all to fall in love with a girl like you

′Cause you can′t run and you can't hide

You and me gonna touch the sky

Pink Floyd - Another Brick In The Wall 

Lifted from ""Pink Floyd The Wall"" film, this video is actually comprised of two songs: ""The Happiest Days Of Our Lives"" and ""Another Brick In The Wall Pt. 2"" This video became the official video of ""Another Brick In The Wall Pt. 2"" after the release of the film in 1982.

This single is by far Pink Floyd's greatest ever mainstream success, instantly attaining classic status, and is perhaps their most famous piece of work. 

ABINTW Pt. 2 even became the protest song of a group of South African students during the apartheid regime, the song was subsequently banned in South Africa. 

The song itself is a protest against the rigidity of British schools, and in particular, the boarding school system Waters would have been part of as a young boy.

The poem read out by the schoolteacher is a direct reference to ""Money""

Lyrics:
I see a red door and I want it painted black
No colors anymore I want them to turn black

I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

I see a line of cars and they're all painted black
With flowers and my love both never to come back

I see people turn their heads and quickly look away
Like a new born baby it just happens every day

I look inside myself and see my heart is black
I see my red door, I must have it painted black

Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts
It's not easy facin' up when your whole world is black

No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee this thing happening to you

If I look hard enough into the settin' sun
My love will laugh with me before the mornin' comes

I see a red door and I want it painted black
No colors anymore I want them to turn black

I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

I wanna see your face, painted black
Black as night, black as coal

I wanna see the sun flying high in the sky
I wanna see it painted, painted, painted, painted black
Yeah!

[Zara Larsson:]
I used to be so happy
But without you here I feel so low
I watched you as you left but I can never seem to let you go
'Cause once upon a time you were my everything
It's clear to see that time hasn't changed a thing
It's buried deep inside me but I feel there's something you should know

I will never forget you
You'll always be by my side
From the day that I met you
I knew that I would love you 'til theday I die
And I will never want much more
And in my heart I will always be sure
I will never forget you
And you will always be by my side 'til the day I die

'Til the day I die ('til the day I die)
'Til the day I die ('til the day I die)

[MNEK:]
Funny how we both end up here but everything seems alright
I wonder what would happen
If we went back and put up a fight
'Cause once upon a time you were my everything
It's clear to see that time hasn't changed a thing
So what in this world do youthink could ever take you off my mind (take you off my mind)

[Zara Larsson:]
I will never forget you
And you'll always be by my side
From the day that I met you
I knew that I would love you 'til the day I die
And I will never want much more
And in my heart I will always be sure
I will never forget you
And you'll always be by my side 'til the day I die

[Both:]
Feeling it, loving it
Everything that we do
And all along, I knew I had something special with you
But sometimes you just gotta know that these things fall through
But I'm still tired and I can't hide my connection with you

Feeling it, loving it
Everything that we do
And all along, I knew I had something special with you
But sometimes you just gotta know that these things fall through
I can't hide my connection with you

I will never forget you
And you'll always be by my side
From the day that I met you
I knew that I would love you 'til the day I die
And I will never want much more
And in my heart I will always be sure
That I will never forget you
And you'll always be by my side 'til the day I die

'Til the day I die... [6x]

I will never forget you...

'Til the day I die.

Lyrics:
Almost heaven, West Virginia, Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River.
Life is old there, older than the trees, younger than the mountains, blowing like a breeze.
Country roads, take me home to the place I belong.
West Virginia, mountain momma, take me home, country roads.

All my memories gather round her, miner's lady, stranger to blue water.
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky, misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye.
Country roads, take me home to the place I belong.
West Virginia, mountain momma, take me home, country roads.",John Denver,country roads take me home country road take me home country roads john denver john denver country roads country roads take me home country road take me home west virginia take me home take me home country road country music almost heaven annies song rocky mountain high thank god im country boy james taylor willie nelson gordon lightfoot john denver audio thanksgiving thanksgiving 2022 thanksgiving songs John Denver,Music,196

Lyrics: Cartoon - On & On (feat. Daniel Levi)

[Verse 1]
Hold me close 'til I get up
Time is barely on our side
I don't wanna waste what's left
The storms we chase are leadin' us
And love is all we'll ever trust, yeah
No, I don't wanna waste what's left

[Chorus]
And on and on we'll go
Through the wastelands, through the highways
'Til my shadow turns to sun-rays
And on and on we'll go
Through the wastelands, through the highways
And on and on we'll go
On we'll go

[Verse 2]
Finding life along the way
Melodies we haven't played
No, I don't want no rest
Echoin' around these walls
Fighting to create a song (yeah)
I don't wanna miss a beat

[Chorus]
And on and on we'll go
Through the wastelands, through the highways
'Til my shadow turns to sun-rays
And on and on we'll go
Through the wastelands, through the highways
And on and on we'll go

[Bridge]
And we'll grow in number
Fuelled by thunder, see the horizon
Turn us to thousands
And we'll grow in number
Fuelled by thunder, see the horizon
Turn us to thousands

[Chorus]
And on and on we'll go
Through the wastelands, through the highways
'Til my shadow turns to sunrays
And on and on we'll go
Through the wastelands, through the highways
And on and on we'll go

Lyrics:

You know the bed feels warmer
Sleeping here alone
You know I dream in colour
And do the things I want

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I'm over cause you're gone

No I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way
The story goes
You always smile but in your eyes 
Your sorrow shows
Yes it shows
No I can't forget tomorrow
When I think of all my sorrow
When I had you there
But then I let you go
And now it's only fair
That I should let you know
What you should know

By now you shoulda, somehow, realized what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now

Back beat, the word is on the street that the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before but you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now

And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how

Because maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall

Today was gonna be the day but they'll never throw it back to you
By now you shoulda somehow realized what you're not to do
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now

And all the roads that lead you there were winding
And all the lights that light the way are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how

I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall

I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall

I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
You're gonna be the one that saves me
You're gonna be the one that saves me

LYRICS
Undo these chains, my friend. I’ll show you the rage I’ve hidden.
Perish the Sacrament. Swallow, but nothing’s forgiven.
You and I can’t decide which of us was taken for granted.
Make amends… some of us are destined to be outlived.

STEP INSIDE/ SEE THE DEVIL IN I
Too many times, we’ve let it come to this
STEP INSIDE/ SEE THE DEVIL IN I
You’ll realize I’m not your Devil anymore

Under the words of men, something is tempting the father.
Where is your will, my friend? Insatiates never even bother.
You and I, wrong or right, traded a lie for the leverage.
In between the lens in light, you’re not what you seem.

STEP INSIDE/ SEE THE DEVIL IN I
Too many times, we’ve let it come to this
STEP INSIDE/ SEE THE DEVIL IN I
You’ll realize I’m not your Devil…
I’m Not Your Devil Anymore

Your Station- Is Abandoned- Fool You ‘cause I know what you’ve done
Sensation- Depravation- You should’ve burned when you turned on everyone

SO STEP INSIDE/ SEE THE DEVIL IN I
Too many times, we’ve let it come to this
STEP INSIDE/ SEE THE DEVIL IN I
Oh, when all that’s left does not make sense
STEP INSIDE/ SEE THE DEVIL IN I
I know you’ll find your answers in the end
STEP INSIDE/ SEE THE DEVIL IN I
You’ll realize I’m not your Devil… anymore

LYRICS
I push my fingers into my eyes...
It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache...
But it's made of all the things I have to take...
Jesus, it never ends, it works it's way inside...
If the pain goes on...

I have screamed until my veins collapsed
I've waited as my time's elapsed
Now, all I do is live with so much fate
I've wished for this, I've bitched at that
I've left behind this little fact:
You cannot kill what you did not create
I've gotta say what I've gotta say
And then I swear I'll go away
But I can't promise you'll enjoy the noise
I guess I'll save the best for last
My future seems like one big past
You're left with me 'cause you left me no choice

I push my fingers into my eyes
It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
If the pain goes on,
I'm not gonna make it!

Put me back together
Or separate the skin from bone
Leave me all the pieces, then you can leave me alone
Tell me the reality is better than the dream
But I found out the hard way,
Nothing is what it seems!

I push my fingers into my eyes
It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
But it's made of all the things I have to take
Jesus, it never ends, it works it's way inside
If the pain goes on,
I'm not gonna make it!

All I've got...all I've got is insane...
All I've got...all I've got is insane...
All I've got...all I've got is insane!
All I've got...all I've got is insane!

I push my fingers into my eyes
It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
But it's made of all the things I have to take
Jesus, it never ends, it works it's way inside

I'm not gonna make it!",Slipknot,Slipknot Duality Metal volume 3 slipknot slipknot (band) heavy metal music corey taylor paul gray clown Paul Gray (American Musician) jim root mick thomson Rock Music Joey Jordison (Musical Artist) Corey Taylor (Musical Artist) Nu Metal (Radio Format) Alternative Metal (Musical Genre) Roadrunner Records (Record Label) Hard Rock (Musical Genre),Music,215

The most loneliest day of my life
Such a lonely day
Should be banned
It's a day that I can't stand

The most loneliest day of my life
The most loneliest day of my life

Such a lonely day
Shouldn't exist
It's a day that I'll never miss
Such a lonely day
And it's mine
The most loneliest day of my life

And if you go
I wanna go with you
And if you die
I wanna die with you
Take your hand and walk away

The most loneliest day of my life
The most loneliest day of my life
The most loneliest day of my life

Such a lonely day
And it's mine
It's a day that I'm glad I survived

Lyrics: 
Do you have the time
To listen to me whine
About nothing and everything all at once?
I am one of those
Melodramatic fools
Neurotic to the bone, no doubt about it

Sometimes, I give myself the creeps
Sometimes, my mind plays tricks on me

It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Am I just stoned?

And I went to a shrink
To analyze my dreams
She says it's lack of sex that's bringing me down
And I went to a whore
He said my life's a bore
So quit my whining 'cause it's bringing her down

Sometimes, I give myself the creeps
Sometimes, my mind plays tricks on me

It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Huh yeah, yeah, yeah (Ooh, ooh)

Grasping to control
So I better hold on

Sometimes, I give myself the creeps
Sometimes, my mind plays tricks on me

It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Am I just stoned?

Lyrics:
Wha-wha-wha-wha-what did you say?
(J-J-J-J-J.R.)
Mmm, whatcha say
Mmm, that you only meant well?
Well, of course you did
Mmm, whatcha say (Jason Derulo)
Mmm, that it's all for the best?
Of course, it is

I (I) was so wrong (Wrong) for so long (Long)
Only tryna please myself (Myself)
Girl, I (I) was caught up (Up) in her lust (Lust)
When I don't really want no one else, so no
I know I should have treated you better (Better)
But me and you were meant to last forever (Forever)
So let me in (Let me in), give me another chance (Another chance)
To really be your man (Oh)

'Cause when the roof caved in and the truth came out
I just didn't know what to do
But when I become a star, we'll be living so large
I'll do anything for you
So tell me, girl

Mmm, whatcha say
Mmm, that you only meant well?
Well, of course you did
Mmm, whatcha say (Whatcha say, whatcha say)
Mmm, that it's all for the best?
Of course it is
Mmm, whatcha say
Mmm, that you only meant well?
Well, of course you did
Mmm, whatcha say (Whatcha say, whatcha say)
Wha-wha-wha-wha-what did you say?

How (How) could I live (Live) with myself (Self)
Knowing that I let our love go? (Love go)
And ooh (Ooh), what I'd do (Do) with one chance (Chance)
I just gotta let you know
I know what I did wasn't clever
But me and you we're meant to be together
So let me in (Let me in), give me another chance (Another chance)
To really be your man

'Cause when the roof caved in and the truth came out
I just didn't know what to do
But when I become a star, we'll be living so large
I'll do anything for you
So tell me, girl

Mmm, whatcha say

Lyrics: 
Come to decide that the things that I tried were in my life just to get high on. 
When I sit alone, come get a little known 
But I need more than myself this time. 
Step from the road to the sea to the sky, and I do believe that we rely on 
When I lay it on, come get to play it on 
All my life to sacrifice. 

Hey oh... listen what I say oh 
I got your hey oh, now listen what I say oh 

When will I know that I really can't go 
To the well once more - time to decide on. 
Well it's killing me, when will I really see, all that I need to look inside. 
Come to belive that I better not leave before I get my chance to ride, 
Well it's killing me, what do I really need - all that I need to look inside. 

Hey oh... listen what I say oh 
Come back and hey oh, look at what I say oh 

The more I see the less I know 
The more I like to let it go - hey oh, woah... 
Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder where it's so white as snow, 
Finally divided by a word so undecided and there's nowhere to go; 
Inbetween the cover of another perfect wonder and it's so white as snow, 
Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed and there's nowhere to go. 

Ho! 
Went to descend to ammend for a friend of the channels that had broken down. 
Now you bring it up, I'm gonna ring it up - just to hear you sing it out. 
Step from the road to the sea to the sky, and I do belive what we rely on, 
When I lay it on, come get to play it on 
All my life to sacrifice 

Hey oh... listen what I say oh 
I got your hey oh... listen what I say oh 

The more I see, the less I know 
The more I like to let it go - hey oh, woah... 
Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder where it's so white as snow. 
Finally divided by a word so undecided and there's nowhere to go 
Inbetween the cover of another perfect wonder where it's so white as snow 
Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed and there's nowhere to go. 

I said hey hey yeah oh yeah, tell my love now. 
Hey hey yeah oh yeah, tell my love now. 

Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder where it's so white as snow, 
Finaly divided by a word so undecided and there's nowhere to go. 
Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder where it's so white as snow...
Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed and there's nowhere to go. 

I said hey oh yeah oh yeah... tell my love now 
Hey yeah yeah... oh yeah.

Lyrics:
This was never the way I planned
Not my intention
I got so brave, drink in hand
Lost my discretion
 
It’s not what
I’m used to
Just wanna try you on
I’m curious for you
Caught my attention
 
(Chorus)
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don’t mind it
It felt so wrong
It felt so right
Don’t mean I’m in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it
 
No I don’t even know your name
It doesn’t matter
You’re my experimental game
Just human nature
 
It’s not what
Good girls do
Not how they should behave
My head gets
So confused
Hard to obey
 
(Chorus)
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don’t mind it
It felt so wrong
It felt so right
Don’t mean I’m in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

Us girls we are so magical
Soft skin, red lips, so kissable
Hard to resist so touchable
Too good to deny it
Ain’t no big deal, it’s innocent
 
(Chorus)
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don’t mind it
It felt so wrong
It felt so right
Don’t mean I’m in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

LYRICS
Stapled shut, inside an outside world 
And I'm sealed in tight, bizarre but right at home
I'm claustrophobic - closing in 
And I'm catastrophic, not again
I'm smeared across the page, and doused in gasoline
I wear you like a stain, yet I'm the one who's obscene
Catch me up on all your sordid little insurrections,
I've got no time to lose, and I'm just caught up in all the cattle

Fray the strings
Throw the shapes
Hold your breath
Listen!

I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget
BEFORE I FORGET THAT!

I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget
BEFORE I FORGET THAT!

I'm ripped across the ditch, and settled in the dirt 
I wear you like a stitch, yet I'm the one who's hurt
Pay attention to your twisted little indiscretions
I've got no right to win, I'm just caught up in all the battles

Locked in clutch
Pushed in place
Hold your breath
Listen!

I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget
BEFORE I FORGET THAT!

I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget
BEFORE I FORGET THAT!

My end
It justifies my means
All I ever do is delay
My every attempt to evade
The end of the road and my end
It justifies my means
All I ever do is delay
My every attempt to evade
THE END OF THE ROAD!

I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget
BEFORE I FORGET THAT!

I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget
BEFORE I FORGET THAT!

I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget

About the album:
Years of musical knowledge and understanding had passed between Angus and Malcolm Young by the time High Voltage announced the arrival of a new Australian take on rock. With Bon Scott on board, this 1976 American release reduced rock 'n' roll down to rhythm, riffs, and raunch.

Legends Never Die when the world is calling you
Can you hear them screaming out your name?
Legends Never Die they become a part of you
Every time you bleed for reaching greatness 
Relentless you survive

They never lose hope when everything's cold and the fighting's near
It's deep in their bones they’ll run into smoke when the fire is fierce
'Oh pick yourself up, ‘cause

Legends Never Die when the world is calling you
Can you hear them screaming out your name?
Legends Never Die they become a part of you
Every time you bleed for reaching greatness 
Legends Never Die

They're written down in eternity
But you'll never see the price it costs, the scars collected all their lives

When everything’s lost, they pick up their hearts and avenge defeat
Before it all starts, they suffer through harm just to touch a dream
'Oh pick yourself up, ‘cause

Legends Never Die when the world is calling you
Can you hear them screaming out your name?
Legends Never Die they become a part of you
Every time you bleed for reaching greatness 
Legends Never Die

When the world is calling out your name
Begging you to fight
Pick yourself up once more
Pick yourself up, ‘cause

Legends Never Die when the world is calling you
Can you hear them screaming out your name?
Legends Never Die they become a part of you
Every time you bleed for reaching greatness

We get the bass thumpin', people jumpin'
All over the world
We got the speakers pumpin' Timmy Trumpet
For the women with curves
Got that freak flow, freak show
Welcome to the circus
Let the Leaders lead, Preachers preach
Welcome to the service

Close the curtains on them if their
Actin' like they never heard us
See we do this for a purpose
Just to keep their fire burnin'
And we don't need no water, let that
Motherfucker burn
Timmy play your trumpet
Let the people go berserk

""Body Head Bangerz: Volume One"" is the first album by the famous American boxer turned rapper, Roy Jones Jr., and his group, Body Head Bangerz. It first came out on August 3, 2004, under Body Head Entertainment, but it got re-released on October 26, 2004, by Universal Music with some changes. The new version had a different album cover and added two new songs called ""Can't Let Go"" and ""Getting Money Right,"" but they took out one song called ""Down Here."" The clean version of the re-release had the same songs as the original but without any bad words. The album has songs with other famous southern hip hop artists like B.G., Lil' Flip, Petey Pablo, Mike Jones, and Bun B. It had two hit songs, ""I Smoke, I Drank"" and ""Can't Be Touched,"" which were played a lot on BET and did well on music charts. One even made it onto the Billboard Hot 100 list. Also, one of the album's tracks, ""Body Head Anthem,"" was featured in the popular video game ""Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition."" This album is remembered as an important part of hip hop history.

Roy Jones Jr. is a famous American boxer who's considered one of the best fighters ever. He was born on January 16, 1969, in Pensacola, Florida. He started boxing professionally in 1989 and got really famous because he was super quick, athletic, and had a unique way of fighting. During his career, he won lots of championships in different weight classes, from middleweight to heavyweight. People called him ""Captain Hook"" because of his really strong left punch. Besides boxing, he also made music, like rap albums, and worked with other musicians. Even though he had some tough times later in his career, his impact on boxing is huge, and he's remembered as one of the greatest boxers ever.

Lyrics:
Standing in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on, heavy glow
By the way, I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for
Dani, the girl, is singing songs to me
Beneath the marquee, overload

Steak knife, card shark
Con job, boot cut
Skin that flick, she's such a little DJ
To get there quick by street but not the freeway
Turn that trick to make a little leeway
Beat that nic, but not the way that we play
Dogtown, blood bath
Rib cage, soft tail

Standing in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on, heavy glow
By the way, I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for

Black jack,dope dick
Pawn shop, quick pick
Kiss that dyke, I know you want to hold one
Not on strike but I'm about to bowl one
Bite that mic, I know you never stole one
Girls that like a story, so I told one
Song bird, main line
Cash back, hard top

Standing in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on, heavy glow
By the way, I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for
Dani, the girl, is singing songs to me
Beneath the marquee, oversold
By the way, I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for

Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it
Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it
Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it
Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it
Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it
Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it
Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it
Ooh, ah

Standing in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on, heavy glow
By the way, I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for
Dani, the girl, is singing songs to me
Beneath the marquee, oversold
By the way, I tried to say
I know you from before

Standing in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on, heavy glow
By the way, I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for

Lyrics:

Reach out and touch faith

Your own personal Jesus
Someone to hear your prayers
Someone who cares
Your own personal Jesus
Someone to hear your prayers
Someone who's there

Feeling unknown
And you're all alone
Flesh and bone
By the telephone
Lift up the receiver
I'll make you a believer

Take second best
Put me to the test
Things on your chest
You need to confess
I will deliver
You know I'm a forgiver",Depeche Mode,depeche mode personal jesus depeche mode official music video acoustic personal jesus music the best of personal jesus lyrics personal jesus live electro instrumental depeche mode vevo depeche mode vevo vol depeche mode official channel official extended download depeche mode lyrics karaoke remix lyrics audio official video cover johnny cash Sony delta machine music video stargate remix playlist single album,Music,226

Lyrics:

I gotta take a little time
A little time to think things over
I better read between the lines
In case I need it when I'm older
Aaaah woah-ah-aah

Now this mountain I must climb
Feels like a world upon my shoulders
And through the clouds I see love shine
It keeps me warm as life grows colder

In my life there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
Can't stop now, I've traveled so far
To change this lonely life

I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is
I know you can show me
Aaaah woah-oh-ooh

I'm gonna take a little time
A little time to look around me, oooh ooh-ooh ooh-ooh oooh
I've got nowhere left to hide
It looks like love has finally found me

In my life there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
I can't stop now, I've traveled so far
To change this lonely life

I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is
I know you can show me
I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
And I wanna feel, I want to feel what love is
And I know, I know you can show me

Let's talk about love
(I wanna know what love is) the love that you feel inside
(I want you to show me) I'm feeling so much love
(I wanna feel what love is) no, you just cannot hide
(I know you can show me) yeah, woah-oh-ooh
I wanna know what love is, let's talk about love
(I want you to show me) I wanna feel it too
(I wanna feel what love is) I wanna feel it too
And I know, and I know, I know you can show me
Show me what is real, woah (woah), yeah I know

Lyrics:
The mirror's image, it tells me it's home time
But I'm not finished, 'cause you're not by my side
And as I arrived I thought I saw you leavin', carryin' your shoes
Decided that once again I was just dreamin' of bumpin' into you

Now it's three in the mornin' and I'm tryin' to change your mind
Left you multiple missed calls and to my message, you reply
""Why'd you only call me when you're high?""
""Hi, why'd you only call me when you're high?""

Somewhere darker, talkin' the same shite
I need a partner, well, are you out tonight?
It's harder and harder to get you to listen
More I get through the gears
Incapable of makin' alright decisions, and havin' bad ideas

Now it's three in the mornin' and I'm tryin' to change your mind
Left you multiple missed calls and to my message you reply
""Why'd you only call me when you're high?""
""Hi, why'd you only call me when you're high?""

And I can't see you here, wonderin' where am I
It sort of feels like I'm runnin' out of time
I haven't found all I was hopin' to find
You said you gotta be up in the mornin'
Gonna have an early night
And you're startin' to bore me, baby

Why'd you only call me when you're high?
""Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?""
""Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?""
""Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?""
""Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?""

LYRICS
Bury all your secrets in my skin
Come away with innocence, 
And leave me with my sins
The air around me still feels like a cage
And love is just a camouflage 
For what resembles rage again...

So if you love me, let me go.
And run away before I know.
My heart is just too dark to care.
I can't destroy what isn't there.
Deliver me into my fate -
If I'm alone I cannot hate
I don't deserve to have you...
My smile was taken long ago
If I can change I hope I never know

I still press your letters to my lips
And cherish them in parts of me that savor every kiss
I couldn't face a life without your light
But all of that was ripped apart when you refused to fight

So save your breath, I will not care.
I think I made it very clear.
You couldn't hate enough to love.
Is that supposed to be enough?
I only wish you weren't my friend.
Then I could hurt you in the end.
I never claimed to be a saint...
Ooh, my own was banished long ago
It took the death of hope to let you go

So break yourself against my stones
And spit your pity in my soul
You never needed any help
You sold me out to save yourself
And I won't listen to your shame
You ran away - you're all the same
Angels lie to keep control...
Ooh, my love was punished long ago
If you still care, don't ever let me know
If you still care, don't ever let me know...",Slipknot,Slipknot Snuff All Hope Is Gone Psychosocial Rock Metal PR.

When I am down and, oh my soul, so weary;
When troubles come and my heart burdened be;
Then, I am still and wait here in the silence,
Until you come and sit awhile with me.

You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;
You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas;
I am strong, when I am on your shoulders;
You raise me up... To more than I can be.

You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;
You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas;
I am strong, when I am on your shoulders;
You raise me up... To more than I can be.

You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;
You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas;
I am strong, when I am on your shoulders;
You raise me up... To more than I can be.

You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;

""(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction"" by the Rolling Stones 
Composers: Mick Jagger, Keith Richards 

Lyrics:

I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
'Cause I try and I try and I try and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no

When I'm drivin' in my car
And that man comes on the radio
And he's tellin' me more and more
About some useless information
Supposed to fire my imagination

I can't get no, oh no no no
Hey hey hey, that's what I say
I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
'Cause I try and I try and I try and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no

When I'm watchin' my TV
And that man comes on to tell me
How white my shirts can be
But he can't be a man 'cause he doesn't smoke
The same cigarettes as me

I can't get no, oh no no no
Hey hey hey, that's what I say
I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no girl reaction
Cause I try and I try and I try and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no

When I'm ridin' round the world
And I'm doin' this and I'm signing that
And I'm tryin' to make some girl
Who tells me baby better come back later next week
Cause you see I'm on losing streak

I can't get no, oh no no no
Hey hey hey, that's what I say
I can't get no, I can't get no
I can't get no satisfaction
No satisfaction, no satisfaction, no satisfaction

Sportacus always manages to save the day and to help the kids of Lazy Town foil Robbie’s latest lazy schemes.

The other kids of Lazy Town are inquisitive, adventurous, playful, and like Stephanie, just trying to figure out their own worlds. Each of them has strengths and weaknesses that all kids can identify withZiggy loves the sweet things in life but struggles to make healthy choices. Stingy has a hard time seeing the benefits of sharing. Pixel is learning how to respect his mind and body by moderating his computer and TV use. Trixie is learning how to make friends by not hurting others and respecting social conventions, and Stephanie is trying to stay true to what feels right for her.

Lyrics:

I used to rule the world
Chunks would load when I gave the word
Now every night I go stow away
Hide from the mobs I used to slay

They once were terrified
Every time I looked into their eyes
Villagers would cheer my way
For a hero I was, that's what they'd say

One minute we had it all
Next our world began to fall
Away from all that it had once become
They all cried for my help, but I stood there numb

I gaze off into the boundless skyline
Noteblock choirs playing in the sunshine
Turn 'round pick up my sword and wield
The blade that once forced evil mobs to yield
And hope one day that this chaos and
Destruction turns for the better
Never a bow in hand
And that was when I ruled the land

It was the creepers and Skeletons
Blew down the doors and boxed us in
Arrows whizzing by like streaks of light
I tried all that I could to stay and fight

As the undead roamed the street
Families broken at my feet
Life itself suspended by a thread
Oh, why is it that I wasn't dead

I gaze off into the boundless skyline
Noteblock choirs playing in the sunshine
Turn 'round pick up my sword and wield
The blade that once forced evil mobs to yield
If this battle should leave me slain
I know that Herobrine calls my name
Better to take a stand
And that was when I ruled the land

LYRICS
Sitting in the dark, I can't forget.
Even now, I realize the time I'll never get.
Another story of the bitter pills of fate.
I can't go back again. I can't go back again...

But you asked me to love you and I did.
Traded my emotions for a contract to commit
And when I got away, I only got so far. 
The other me is dead.
I hear his voice inside my head...

We were never alive, and we won't be born again.
But I'll never survive with dead memories in my heart.

You told me to love you and I did. 
Tied my soul into a knot and got me to submit.
So when I got away, I only kept my scars. 
The other me is gone.
Now I don't know where I belong...

We were never alive, and we won't be born again.
But I'll never survive with dead memories in my heart.

Dead visions in your name.
Dead fingers in my veins.
Dead memories in my heart",Slipknot,Slipknot Dead Memories Metal Slipknot (band) corey taylor jim root paul gray mick thomson clown all hope is gone heavy metal music Joey Jordison (Musical Artist) Paul Gray (Musical Artist) Nu Metal (Radio Format) Alternative Metal (Musical Genre) Hard Rock (Musical Genre) Roadrunner Records (Record Label) Paul Gray (Award Winner) Official Warner Music Group (Record Label),Music,294

LYRICS
I've felt the hate rise up in me... 
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves... 
I wander out where you can't see... 
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed... 

Goodbye! 

I wipe it off on tile, the light is brighter this time 
Everything is 3D blasphemy 
My eyes are red and gold, the hair is standing straight up 
This is not the way I pictured me 
I can't control my shakes 
How the hell did I get here? 
Something about this, so very wrong... 
I have to laugh out loud, I wish I didn't like this 
Is it a dream or a memory? 

I've felt the hate rise up in me... 
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves... 
I wander out where you can't see... 
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed... 

Get outta my head cuz I don't need this 
Why I didn't I see this? 
I'm a victim - Manchurian candidate 
I have sinned by just 
Makin' my mind up and takin' your breath away 

I've felt the hate rise up in me... 
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves... 
I wander over where you can't see... 
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed... 

Goodbye! 

You haven't learned a thing 
I haven't changed a thing 
My flesh was in my bones 
The pain was always free 

I've felt the hate rise up in me... 
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves... 
I wander out where you can't see... 
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed...

Lyrics:
Closet full of secrets and skeletons awakes but nothing's true
I used to own a castle now it's boxes that I have to move 
Right here in the darkness there's nothing left for me to do
It's easier to run away but today
Today we got to

Cast the shadows out from sight
A final stand a shouting cry
All the wrongs now turned to right
So fight the past 
Take back the night
And call upon the torch tonight
To bring out all the ghosts to light 
Because at last we have to go it's time
To take back the night

Bridges burned and broken on different sides we start anew
Being chased by monsters to face head on or be consumed
Reaching out for something grasping on to nothing to lose
Paybacks left too long unpaid but today
Today we got to

Cast the shadows out from sight
A final stand a shouting cry
All the wrongs now turned to right
So fight the past 
Take back the night
And call upon the torch tonight
To bring out all the ghosts to light 
Because at last we have to go it's time
To take back the night",CaptainSparklez,minecraft song music video captainsparklez captain sparklez tryhardninja bootstrap buckaroo fyreuk doc exx slamacow creations take back the night take back the night animated animation original dig build live digbuildlive herobrine adventure,Music,390

On the mic with a dope rhyme
Jump to the rhythm, jump, jump to the rhythm, jump
And I'm here to combine
Beats and lyrics to make your shake your pants
Take a chance, come on and dance
Guys, grab a girl, don't wait, make her twirl
It's your world and I'm just a squirrel
Tryin' to get a nut to move your butt
To the dance floor, so yo what's up
Hands in the air, come on, say ""yeah""

Pause, take a breath and go for yours
On my command now hit the dance floor
It's gonna make you sweat 'til you bleed
Is that dope enough? Indeed
I paid the price, to control the dice
I'm more precise, to the point I'm nice
The music takes control, your heart and soul
Unfold, your body is free and a whole
Dance till you can't, dance till you can't dance no more
Get on the floor and get raw
Then come back and upside down
Easy now, let me see ya
Move (let your mind)

[Intro]
Blah blah blablah.

[Verse 1]
Wanna join me, come and play.
But I might shoot you, in your face.
Bombs and bullets will, do the trick.
What we need here, is a little bit of panic!

Do you ever wanna catch me?
Right now I'm feeling ignored!
So can you try a little harder?
I'm really getting bored!

[Chorus]
Come on, shoot faster,
Just a little bit of energy!
I wanna try something fun right now,
I guess some people call it anarchy!

Let's blow this city to ashes, 
And see what Pow-Pow thinks.
It's such pathetic neatness,
But not for long 'cause it'll get jinxed!

[Verse 2]
So much better, so much fun.
Let's start from scratch and, blow up the sun!

[Chorus]
Come on, shoot faster,
Just a little bit of energy!
I wanna try something fun right now,
I guess some people call it anarchy!

Let's blow this city to ashes, 
And see what Pow-Pow thinks.
It's such pathetic neatness,
But not for long 'cause it'll get jinxed!

[End]
Come on!
Come on!
And get jinxed!

LYRICS
My guilt and my shame always sell me short - always feel the same
And my face and my soul always wear me thin - always under control
But the longest hours you'll have in your life
Are the ones you sit through to know if you're right
So I'll wait, but I pray that I'm wrong
Because I think I know what's going on

So let me get this straight... the only will is my own
I do whatever I want and stay alone
All my decisions make it untouchable and tainted
I'm gonna suffer for the rest of my life
But I will always find a way to survive
I'm not a failure, but I know what it's like
I can take it or leave it... or die

STAY - You don't always know where you stand
'Til you know that you won't run away
There's something inside me that feels
Like breathing in sulfur...

My life is undone - and I'm a sinner to most but a sage to some
And my gods are untrue - I'm probably wrong, but I'm better than you
And the longest hours I've had in my life
Were the ones I went through to know I was right
So I'm safe, but I'm a little outside
I'm gonna laugh when I'm buried alive

STAY - You don't always know where you stand
'Til you know that you won't run away
There's something inside me that feels
Like Breathing in Sulfur...

LIKE BREATHING IN SULFUR

STAY - You don't always know where you stand
'Til you know that you won't run away
There's something inside me that feels
Like Breathing in Sulfur...

The Kombucha mushroom people
Sitting around all day
Who can believe you?
Who can believe you?
Let your mother pray
Sugar
Sugar
I'm not there all the time, you know
Some people, some people, some people
Call it insane, yeah, they call it insane (sugar)
I play Russian Roulette everyday, a man's sport
With a bullet called life, yeah, mama, called life (sugar)
You know that every time I try to go
Where I really wanna be
It's already where I am
'Cause I'm already there
The Kombucha mushroom people
Sitting around all day
Who can believe you?
Who can believe you?
Let your mother pray
Sugar
I got a gun the other day from Sako
It's cute, small, fits right in my pocket
Yeah, right in my pocket (sugar)
My girl, you know, she lashes out at me sometimes
And I just fucking kick her, and then, ooh baby, she's okay (sugar)
People are always chasing me down
Trying to push my face to the ground
Where all they do is suck out my motherfucking brains, my brains (sugar)
The Kombucha mushroom people
Sitting around all day
Who can believe you?
Who can believe you?
Let your mother pray
I sit, in my desolate room
No lights, no music
Just anger
I've killed everyone
I'm away forever, but I'm feeling better
How do I feel?
What do I say?
Fuck you, it all goes away
How do I feel?
What do I say?
Fuck you, it all goes away
How do I feel?
What do I say?
In the end it all goes away
How do I feel?
What do I say?
In the end it all goes away
How do I feel?
What do I say?
In the end it all goes away
How do I feel?
What do I say?
In the end it all goes away

Lyrics:
The house of pain is in effect ya'll
The house of pain is in effect
You know the house of pain is in effect
And anyone that steps up is gettin' wrecked
Pack it up, pack it in, let me begin
I came to win, battle me that's a sin
I won't ever slack up, punk you better back up
Try and play the role and yo the whole crew'll act up
Get up, stand up (c'mon!) c'mon throw your hands up
If you've got the feeling, jump across the ceiling
Muggs lifts a funk flow, someone's talking junk
Yo I bust him in the eye, and then I'll take the punk's hoe
Feelin, funkin, amps in the trunk and I got more rhymes
than there's cops at a Dunkin' Donuts shop
Sho' nuff, I got props
From the kids on the Hill plus my mom and my pops
I came to get down, I came to get down
So get out your seat and jump around!
Jump around! (3X)
Jump up, jump up and get down!
Jump! (17X)
I'll serve your ass like John McEnroe
If your girl steps up, I'm smacking the hoe
Word to your moms, I came to drop bombs
I got more rhymes than the Bible's got Psalms
And just like the Prodigal Son I've returned
Anyone stepping to me you'll get burned
Cause I got lyrics, but you ain't got none
If you come to battle bring a shotgun!
But if you do you're a fool, cause I duel, to the death
Trying to step to me, you'll take your last breath
I got the skills, come get your fill
Cause when I shoot the gift, I shoot to Kill
I came to get down, I came to get down
So get out your seat and jump around!
Jump around! (3X)
Jump up, jump up and get down!
Jump! (17X)
I'm the cream of the crop, I rise to the top
I never eat a pig, cause a pig is a cop
Or better yet a Terminator, like Arnold Schwarzenegger
Try to play me out like, as if my name was Sega
But I ain't going out like no punk bitch
Get used to one style and yo and I might switch
it up up and around, then buck buck you down
Put out your head and then you wake up in the Dawn of the Dead
I'm coming to get ya, I'm coming to get ya
Spitting out lyrics, homie I'll wet ya
I came to get down, I came to get down
So get out your seat and jump around!
Jump around! (3X)
Jump up, jump up and get down!
Jump! (33X)
Yo, this is dedicated.. to Joe..DeBerg..Dakota!
Grab your bozack, punk!

Lyrics: 
Once I was seven years old my mama told me, 
Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely
Once I was seven years old

It was a big, big world but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
By eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor 
Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure

Once I was eleven years old my daddy told me, 
Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely
Once I was eleven years old

I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
‘Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

Once I was twenty years old my story got told
Before the morning sun when life was lonely
Once I was twenty years old

I only see my goals I don't believe in failure
‘Cause I know the smallest voices they can make it major
I got my boys with me, at least those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave I hope I'll see you later

Once I was twenty years old my story got told 
I waswriting 'bout everything I saw before me
Once I was twenty years old

Soon we'll be thirty years old, our songs have been sold 
We'vetraveled around the world and we're still roaming
Soon we'll be thirty years old

I'm still learning about life, my woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs and I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me, some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind, my brother I'm still sorry

Soon I'll be sixty years old, my daddy got sixty-one 
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit once or twice a month

Soon I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me
Soon I'll be sixty years old

""Riders On The Storm"" was the last song recorded by the members of The Doors, according to Ray, as well as Jim´s last recorded song to be released (recorded December 1970 - January 1971 - released in June ´71).

According to Robby, it was inspired by the song ""(Ghost) Riders in the Sky: A Cowboy Legend."" The song is played in the E Dorian mode, and incorporates real sound effects of thunder and rain, along with Ray´s Fender Rhodes electric piano playing, which emulates the sound of rain. The song was recorded at the Doors Workshop in December 1970 with the assistance of Bruce Botnick, their longtime engineer, who was co-producing the recording sessions. Jim recorded his main vocals and then whispered the lyrics over them to create the echo effect. The single was released in 1971, shortly before Jim´s death, entering the Hot 100 on 3 July 1971, the day that Jim died.

The Doors' former producer, Paul Rothchild left prior to the sessions as he did not like the album, or the song, calling it ""cocktail music"". Their engineer Bruce Botnick was selected to produce the album instead.

The band's drummer John Densmore wrote a 1990 book called Riders on the Storm, detailing the story of his life and his time with the group.

Ray Manzarek and guitarist Roy Rogers covered this song as an instrumental duet on their 2008 album ""Ballads Before the Rain"".

In November 2009, the song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame under the category Rock (track).",JimJohnRayRobby,riders on the storm the doors doors jim morrison car driving jim car blue lady shelby gt500 the end when the musics over people are strange break on through hyacinth house thunder storm lightning james douglas morrison HWY when youre strange film movie lyrics facts re-upload tanjadoor driving with jim jim driving,Education,425

#GreenDay #Nimrod25 #GoodRiddanceTimeOfYourLife

Lyrics: 
Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road
Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go
So make the best of this test and don't ask why
It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time

It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life

So take the photographs and still frames in your mind
Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time
Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial
For what it's worth, it was worth all the while

It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life

It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life
It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life...

Red Hot Chili Peppers is a rock band renowned for their hits “Californication,” “Otherside,” “Scar Tissue,” “Dani California,” “Can’t Stop,” “Snow (Hey Oh),” and “Dark Necessities.” They worked with artists like George Clinton, Eddie Vedder, and Elton John — amassing billions of global streams and inducted into the “Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.”

Lyrics: 
I got a bad disease
Up from my brain is where I bleed
Insanity it seems
Has got me by my soul to squeeze
Well all the love from me
With all the dying trees I scream
The angels in my dreams, yeah
Have turned to demons of greed
That's mean

Where I go, I just don't know
I got to, got to, gotta take it slow
When I find my peace of mind
I'm gonna give you some of my good time

Today love smiled on me
It took away my pain, said please
I’ll let your ride be free
You gotta let it be
Oh yeah

Where I go, I just don't know
I got to, gotta, gotta take it slow
When I find my peace of mind
I'm gonna give you some of my good time

You're so polite indeed
Well I got everything I need
Oh make my days a breeze
And take away my self destruction
It's bitter baby and it's very sweet
A holy rollercoaster but I'm on my feet
Take me to the river, let me on your shore
Well, I'll be coming back baby, I'll be coming back for more

Doo doo doo doo dingle zing a dong bone
Ba-di ba-da ba-zumba crunga cong gone bad
I could not forget but I will not endeavour
Simple pleasures are much better, but I won’t regret it, never

Where I go, I just don't know
I got to, got to, gotta take it slow
When I find my peace of mind
I'm gonna give you some of my good time

Where I go I just don't know
I might end up somewhere in Mexico
When I find my peace of mind
I'm gonna keep it for the end of time

[1] - [2Pac singing in background 2X]
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin at me
But they can't do nuttin to a G

(Let's get ready to ruuumbllle!!)

[1] - [2Pac speaking over background]
Now you know how we do it like a G
What really go on in the mind of a nigga
that get down for theirs
Constantly, money over bitches

[2] - [2Pac singing in background starts to overlap/repeat]
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin at me
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
Police bustin at me
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah / Got the police bustin at me
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah..

[2] - [2Pac speaking over background]
Not bitches over money
Stay on your grind nigga
My ambitions as a ridah!
My ambitions as a ridah!

[2Pac]
So many battlefield scars while driven in plush cars
This life as a rap star is nothin without heart
Was born rough and rugged, addressin the mad public
My attitude was, ""Fuck it,"" cause motherfuckers love it
To be a soldier, must maintain composure at ease
Though life is complicated, only what you make it to be
Uhh, and my ambitions as a ridah to catch her
while she hot, and horny, go up inside her
Then I spit some game in her ear, ""Go to the tele hoe""
Equipped with money and a Benz, cause bitch I'm barely broke
I'm smokin bomb-ass weed feelin crucial
From player to player, the game's tight, the feeling's mutual
From hustlin and prayers, to breakin motherfuckers to pay-up
I got no time for these bitches, cause these hoes tried to play us
I'm on a meal-ticket mission, want a mil', so I'm wishin
Competition got me ripped, on that bullshit they stressin (boo-yaa!)
I'ma rhyme though, clown hoes like it's manditory
No guts no glory my nigga bitch got the game distorted
Now it's on and it's on because I said so
Can't trust a bitch in the bidness so I got with Death Row
Now these money hungry bitches gettin suspicious
Started plottin and plannin on schemes, to come and trick us
But Thug niggaz be on point and game tight (yeah)
Me, Syke and Bogart, wrap it up the same night
Got problems then handle it, motherfuckers see me
These niggaz is jealous cause deep in they heart they wanna be me
Uhh, yeah, and now ya got me right beside ya
Hopin you listen I catch you payin attention 
to my amibitions as a ridah

[Chorus: 2Pac]

[singing] I won't deny it, I'ma straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
[singing] My ambitions as a ridah
[singing] Got the police bustin at me
But they can't do nuttin to a G 

[Tupac]
(I won't deny it, I'ma straight ridah)
Peep it.. it was my only wish to rise
above these jealous coward mutherfuckers I despise
When it's time to ride, I was the first off this side, give me the nine
I'm ready to die right here tonight, and motherfuck they life (yeah nigga!)
That's what they screamin as they drill me, but I'm hard to kill
So open fire, I see you kill me (that's all you niggaz got?) witness my steel
Spittin at adversaries envious and after me
I'd rather die before they capture me, watch me bleed
Mama come rescue me I'm suicidal thinkin thoughts
I'm innocent, so there'll be bullets flyin when I'm caught
(Shoot!) Fuck doin jail time, better day, sacrifice
Won't get a chance to do me like they did my nigga Tyson
Thuggin for life and if you right then nigga die for it
Let them other brothers try, at least you tried for it
When it's time to die to be a man you pick the way you leave
Fuck peace and the police, my ambitions as a ridah

[Chorus]

[Tupac]
My murderous lyrics equipped with spirits of the Thugs before me
Pay off the block evade the cops cause I know they comin for me
I been hesitant to reappear, been away for years
Now I'm back my adversaries been reduced to tears
Question my methods to switch up speeds, sure as some bitches bleeds
niggaz'll feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed
Blast me but they didn't finish, (buck buck buck buck buck)
didn't diminish my powers
so now I'm back to be a motherfuckin menace, they cowards
That's why they tried to set me up
Had bitch-ass niggaz on my team, so indeed, they wet me up
But I'm back reincarnated, incarcerated
At the time I contemplate the way that God made it
Lace em with lyrics that's legendary, musical mercenary
For money, I'll have these motherfuckers buried (I been)
gettin much mail in jail, niggaz tellin me to kill it
Knowin when I get out, they gon' feel it
Witness the realest, a whoridah when I put the shit inside
the cry from all your people when they find her
Just remind ya, my history'll prove I been it
Revenge on them niggaz that played me, 
and all the cowards that was down widdit
Now it's yo' nigga right beside ya
Hopin you listenin, catch you payin attention 
to my ambitions as a ridah

Official Lyrics: 

Theres a county map to go on the wall,
A hurling stick & a shinty ball,
The bric, the brac, the craic & all,
Lets call it an Irish pub,
Caffreys, Harp, Kilkenny on tap,
The Guinness pie & that cabbage crap,
The ideal wannabee Paddy trap,
We'll call it an Irish pub,

Whale, oil, beef, hooked! I swear upon the holy book,
The only 'craic' you'll get is a slap in the ear,
Whale, oil, beef, hooked! I'll up & burst yer filthy mug,
If you draw one more shamrock in me beer!

We'll raise the price o' beer a dollar,
We'll make em wear a shirt & collar,
We'll fly a bloody tri-colour,
And call it an Irish pub,
Jager bombs & double shots,
The underagers think its tops,
We'll spike the drinks & pay the cops,
We got us an Irish pub.

The quick one in the filthy bog,
The partin' glass across the lug,
O' the lady-O, the dirty dog,
We got us an Irish pub,
It's over to me and over to you,
We'll skip along the Avenue,
And who t'hell is Ronnie Drew?
We got us an Irish pub.

Plasma screens & neon lights,
Kara-farkin-oke nights,
The bouncers they can pick the fights,
We'll call it an Irish pub,
Plastic cups, a polished floor,
We'll hose the blood right out the door,
And let the knucklers back for more,
We got us an Irish pub,

Oh top o' the mornin', Garryowen,
Kiss me I'm Irish, Molly Malone,
Failte, Slainte, Pog ma thon,
We got us an Irish pub,
Spike the punch & strip the willow,
Strike me up the rakes o' Mallow,
The Liffey never ran so shallow,
We got us an Irish pub.

Lyrics:

My, my, at Waterloo Napoleon did surrender 
oh yeah, and I have met my destiny 
in quite a similar way 
the history book on the shelf 
is always repeating itself 

Waterloo – I was defeated, you won the war 
Waterloo – promise to love you for ever more 
Waterloo – couldn’t escape if I wanted to 
Waterloo – knowing my fate is to be with you 
Wa, wa, wa, wa, Waterloo – finally facing my Waterloo 

My, my, I tried to hold you back but you were stronger 
oh yeah, and now it seems my only chance 
is giving up the fight 
and how could I ever refuse 
I feel like I win when I lose 

Waterloo – I was defeated, you won the war 
Waterloo – promise to love you for ever more 
Waterloo – couldn’t escape if I wanted to 
Waterloo – knowing my fate is to be with you 
Wa, wa, wa, wa, Waterloo – finally facing my Waterloo 

So how could I ever refuse 
I feel like I win when I lose – 

Waterloo – couldn’t escape if I wanted to 
Waterloo – knowing my fate is to be with you 
Wa, wa, wa, wa, Waterloo – finally facing my Waterloo

Lyrics:

Look in my eyes, what do you see?
The cult of personality
I know your anger, I know your dreams
I've been everything you want to be

I'm the cult of personality
Like Mussolini and Kennedy
I'm the cult of personality
The cult of personality
The cult of personality

Neon lights, Nobel Prize
When a mirror speaks, the reflection lies
You won't have to follow me
Only you can set me free

Fear of The Dark
1992

Lyrics:
I am a man who walks alone
And when I'm walking a dark road
At night or strolling through the park

When the light begins to change
I sometimes feel a little strange
A little anxious when it's dark

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a constant fear that something's
Always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's
Always there

Have you run your fingers down
The wall
And have you felt your neck skin crawl
When you're searching for the light?
Sometimes when you're scared
To take a look
At the corner of the room
You've sensed that something's
Watching you

Thought you heard footsteps behind
And turned around and no one's there?
And as you quicken up your pace
You find it hard to look again
Because you're sure there's
Someone there

Watching horror films the night before
Debating witches and folklore
The unknown troubles on your mind
Maybe your mind is playing tricks
You sense, and suddenly eyes fix
On dancing shadows from behind

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have constant fear that something's
Always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's
Always there

When I'm walking a dark road
I am a man who walks alone

Lyrics:

I am the one, don't weigh a ton
Don't need a gun to get respect up on the street
Under the sun, the bastard son
Will pop the Glock to feed himself and family
By any means, your enemies my enemies
We wet them up like a canteen
The yellow tape surrounds the fate
Don't have a face so now you late, open the gates

Great, eliminate like ElimiDate
Hey, young boy had to penetrate
Face, young boy done caught a case
Bang, now his mama living with the pain
Wait, doctor says he's gonna stay
Let him get the senzu bean so he regenerate
Now a nigga harder than the head of the state
Denzel Curry is the new candidate
Ultimate, alternate, you are the opposite
Stop this shit, chop your esophagus
Bitches be bopping it, bow down and popping it
Dropping it in her esophagus
She get so nasty, in public she classy
Perhaps she is able to swallow it
Girl, I can make you a star
Then I put her ass on Apollo, bitch
Bitch, I am ultimate, behold my awesomeness
Narcissist, part time an arsonist
Ripping through cartilage, I am the hardest, bitch
Wrap it up, put in sarcophagus
Dearly departed, it's done when it started
So now that I'm living so harmonious
Feeling like Spartacus, Curry the ultimate
I am the best, there's no politics, bitch, I'm ultimate

I am the one, don't weigh a ton
Don't need a gun to get respect up on the street
Under the sun, the bastard son
Will pop the Glock to feed himself and family
By any means, your enemies my enemies
We wet them up like a canteen
The yellow tape surrounds the fate
Don't have a face so now you late, open the gates

Ultimate, infinite, flow is opium
Open the internet, photosynthesis
Put up parentheses, temporary
Very scary if I feel like Dirty Harry
Just might bust a bitch, never knew my life
But yet the question is is he fake, is he real
What the message is, chop a bitch nigga up
I’ma sever it when I sever shit
I kill 'em, no Kony, these niggas ain't homies
Claim you the homie, I turn into Broly
Dropping melodic, enter the cosmic
Flow like a prophet, lyrical toxic
Flow like a foreigner, I’m the torturer
Out of South Florida, call the coroner
Killed in the corridor, I’m the overlord
Rhymes like a sorcerer, I’m an animorph
Bitch, I’m a beast
Nigga, you tell me who fucking with me
K to the I to the N to the G
Claim you the hottest, but I disagree
Better love something than get a degree
This for lord infamous so R.I.P
Arrivederci, bitches looking thirsty, riding through the dirty
Like it’s mandatory, ending of the story

I am the one, don't weigh a ton
Don't need a gun to get respect up on the street
Under the sun, the bastard son
Will pop the glock to feed himself and family
By any means, your enemies my enemies
We wet them up like a canteen
The yellow tape surrounds the fate
Don't have a face so now you late, open the gates.",Cap'n,Denzel Curry Ultimate 32/Zel Planet Shrooms Full album Experimental Hip Hop Hip Hop Lyrics Lirics Lyric Video Raider Klan Rap Liric Video Music Video Music Vid.

Verse 1
It’s late at night I go to bed
But I can’t get no rest
My boyfriend quit I’m almost dead
I’ll have to do my best! 
I’m up and down I feel so fat
I ain’t got no more fizz
Don’t even get to keep the cat
But that’s just how it is! 

Chorus 1
I Sing…
Wap bap wah da de da dah
Dap bap bah da de da dah
Dap bap bah da de da dah dah! 
Wap bap wah da de da dah
Dap bap wah da de da dah
Dap bap Bah da de da dah dah! 

Verse 2
I get up late I stub my toe
I’ve got a few missed calls
I lost my job I didn’t know
And that’s not good at all! 
I get my bag I go outside
Just minding my own biz
I go to pay but my card has been denied
But that’s just how it is! 

Chorus 2
I Sing…
Wap bap wah da de da dah
Dap bap bah da de da dah
Dap bap bah da de da dah dah! 
And everybody sing…
Wap bap wah da de da dah
Dap bap wah da de da dah
Dap bap Bah da de da dah dah

Verse 3
Another week the same old shit
My troubles getting worse
And then I get a bigger hit
Cos someone stole my purse! 
I met a guy he knows my name
He also told me his
And if we want to have some fun 
Well that’s just how it is

Chorus 3

************************************************

Blinded by hate brought by the fall 
As I swear death to all
You will feel my vengeance
As I claim your mortal soul

I will punish and destroy 
Those responsible for this ploy
I will seek a thousand deaths
I will bring a thousand years of war

All that I had taken away
My home is gone, and my love ones slain
For every sleep claims a piece of me 
Every waking moment, every single dream

As the masses came
Like a shadow through this land 
They laid siege to all we ever had
I stood strong, I was honor bound 
I stand defiant, I stand ever proud 
I am the chosen
I am the guardian, the guardian

Now I seek the blood of those 
Who claimed the innocent
I will hunt the enemy to the last
I will banish and rejoice
The final breath of foes
You will see what you have made 
You will see what I have finally become

All that I had laid to the waste
My spirit broken and just memories remain 
For every day claims a piece of me 
Every waking hour claims my inner peace 
My inner peace

As the masses came
Like a shadow through this land 
They laid siege to all we ever had
I stood strong, I was honor bound 
I stand defiant, I stand ever proud
I am the chosen
I am the guardian, the guardian

TU NEMA PRAVDE,
TU NEMA KRUHA,
TU GDJE JE PROŠLA TVOJA RUKA
TI IDEŠ VANI KO TSUNAMI
I DRUGU GRLIŠ OKO STRUKA
TI IDEŠ KUĆI, PJEVAJUĆI
A JA MORAM BITI SAMA
MA JOŠ JE DOBRA, PAMET MOJA
JA OSTAVLJAM TE OVIH DANA
OSTAVLJAM TE OVIH DANA

TI NE ZNAŠ DA SAM TU
A ONA, PIJANA DO POLA 
TI PLEŠE OKO STOLA
TI VIDIŠ SAMO NJU
A JA NE DAM 
DA PRAVIŠ ME BUDALOM NI DAN
A TI BI MALO
JEDNU, PA DRUGU, PA DVIJE
A TAKO MILI ODLAZI DO VRAGA SVE
I NEMA NIČEG IZMEĐU TEBE I NJE
AKO TEBE PITAM
AL VIŠE NISI BITAN

JA NEĆU DALJE
JER NEMAŠ SLUHA
I NE SLUŠAŠ ME NI TRENUTKA
TI IDEŠ VANI KO TSUNAMI
I DRUGU GRLIŠ OKO STRUKA
TI IDEŠ KUĆI, PJEVAJUĆI
A JA MORAM BITI SAMA
MA JOŠ JE DOBRA, PAMET MOJA

Lyrics:

Kažu

Kažu da je Bosna samo država za rođaka
i da smo na vrhu liste po odlivu ""mozaka""

Kažu opet Iran pravi nuklearne bombe 
žvaka čisti zube al' izvaljuje plombe

Kažu što je babi milo to joj se i snilo
kažu na Jamajci gandžu prodaju na kilo

Kažu nemoj vode vruć, kod nas propuh ubija
igrali smo dobro ali zajeb'o nas sudija

Kažu da je alkohol zdraviji od trave
kažu ako nemaš stav odma' ti ga stave

Kažu da su plavke gluplje nego crnke i brinete
i da okus bude bolji s kašikom Vegete

Kažu neće nikad prestat' glave da nam pune
Sve dok je ovaca neće falit' vune

Spale su nam gaće, zagrizli smo udice
Glave nam u pijesku, nezaštićene guzice

Kažu da je smak svijeta relativno blizu
i da su nas banke uvukle u krizu

Mene tjeraju na izbore svake dvije godine,
a ja glasam za kafanu i marihuanu

Od Vatikana do Irana
Kao da smo juče pali s grana
Od Vatikana do Irana
majmunu je dovoljna banana

Od Vatikana do Irana
Kao da smo juče pali s grana
Od Vatikana do Irana
ilegalna je marihuana

Kažu da malu djecu donosi nam roda
i da jedino je zdrava flaširana voda

Kažu da uz pjesmu efikasnije se trlja
čudotvorni sapun protiv tvrdokornih mrlja

Kažu neće nikad prestat' glave da nam pune
Sve dok je ovaca neće falit' vune

Spale su nam gaće, zagrizli smo udice
Glave nam u pijesku, nezaštićene guzice

Kažu da je smak svijeta relativno blizu
i da su nas banke uvukle u krizu

Mene tjeraju na izbore svake dvije godine
a ja glasam za kafanu i marihuanu

Od Vatikana do Irana
Kao da smo juče pali s grana
Od Vatikana do Irana
majmunu je dovoljna banana

Od Vatikana do Irana
Kao da smo juče pali s grana
Od Vatikana do Irana
ilegalna je marihuana

Paroles :

All my friends are heathens, take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abused
Tous mes amis sont païens, vas-y doucement
J'attends qu'ils te demandent qui tu connais
S'il te plaît, ne fais pas de geste brusque
Tu ne sais pas la moitié de ce qu'ils ont enduré

All my friends are heathens, take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abused
Tous mes amis sont païens, vas-y doucement
J'attends qu'ils te demandent qui tu connais
S'il te plaît, ne fais pas de geste brusque
Tu ne sais pas la moitié de ce qu'ils ont enduré

Welcome to the room of people
Who have rooms of people that they loved one day
Docked away
Just because we check the guns at the door
Doesn't mean our brains will change from hand grenades
Bienvenue dans la salle remplie de personnes
Qui ont de la place pour les personnes qu'ils ont aimées un jour
Enfermés
Ce n'est pas parce qu'on vérifie les armes à la porte
que nos cerveaux vont se changer en grenades

You'll never known the psychopath sitting next to you
You'll never known the murderer sitting next to you
You'll think, ""How'd I get here, sitting next to you?""
But after all I've said, please don't forget
Tu ne connaîtras jamais le psychopathe assis à côté de toi
Tu ne connaîtras jamais le meurtrier assis à côté de toi
Tu penseras ""Comment en suis-je arrivé à être assis là près de toi?""
Mais après tout ce que j'ai dit, s'il te plaît n'oublie pas

All my friends are heathens, take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abused
Tous mes amis sont païens, vas-y doucement
J'attends qu'ils te demandent qui tu connais
S'il te plaît, ne fais pas de geste brusque
Tu ne sais pas la moitié de ce qu'ils ont enduré

We don't deal with outsiders very well
They say newcomers have a certain smell
Yeah, I trust issues, not to mention
They say they can smell your intentions
On ne s'occupe pas très bien des étrangers
Ils disent que les nouveaux venus ont une certaine odeur
Ouais j'ai des problèmes de confiance, sans oublier
Qu'ils disent qu'il peuvent sentir tes intentions

You'll never known the freakshow sitting next to you
You'll have some weird people sitting next to you
You'll think ""How did I get here, sitting next to you?""
But after all I've said, please don't forget
(Watch it, watch it)
Tu ne connaîtras jamais la bête de foire assise à côté de toi
Tu auras des personnes bizarres assises à côté de toi
Tu penseras ""Comment en suis-je arrivé à être assis ici à côté de toi?""
Mais après tout ce que j'ai dit, s'il te plaît n'oublie pas
(Fais gaffe, fais gaffe)

All my friends are heathens, take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abused

Why'd you come, you knew you should have stayed
(It's blasphemy)
I tried to warn you just to stay away
And now they're outside ready to bust
It looks like you might be one of us
Pourquoi tu es venu, tu savais que tu aurais dû rester
(C'est du blasphème)

LYRICS:

Tell me where do I go
Tell me where do I take us
Your heart is starting to slow
May the water be safer
As I dive in

Blood stains washing underneath the waves
(As we fall, as we fall)
I'll be reaching out to keep you safe
(as we fall, as we fall, as we fall)

I can’t hold on much longer
We’re drifting down to the other side
Tried to pull us under
Keep holding out for the other side

Tell me where do I go
Tell me where do I take us
Tell me where do I go
Tell me where do I take us

Your heart is starting to slow
May the water be safer
As I dive in

Your heart is starting to slow
May the water be safer
As we fall

I can’t hold on much longer
We’re drifting down to the other side
Tried to pull us under
Keep holding out for the other side

Lyrics:

I open my eyes
I try to see but I'm blinded by the white light
I can't remember how
I can't remember why
I'm lying here tonight
And I can't stand the pain
And I can't make it go away
No I can't stand the pain
How could this happen to me
I've made my mistakes
I've got no where to run
The night goes on
As I'm fading away
I'm sick of this life
I just wanna scream
How could this happen to me
Everybody's screaming
I try to make a sound but no one hears me
I'm slipping off the edge
I'm hanging by a thread
I wanna start this over again
So I try to hold onto a time when nothing mattered
And I can't explain what happened
And I can't erase the things that I've done
No I can't
How could this happen to me
I've made my mistakes
I've got no where to run
The night goes on
As I'm fading away
I'm sick of this life
I just wanna scream
How could this happen to me
I've made my mistakes
I've got no where to run
The night goes on
As I'm fading away
I'm sick of this life
I just wanna scream
How could this happen to me

(N. Badrić / P. Martinjak - N. Badrić / P. Martinjak - P. Martinjak)
(p) & (c) Aquarius Records, 2016.
redatelj: Darko Drinovac

Pjesmom ""Dani i godine"" Nina Badrić glazbena diva i ljubimica regije najavljuje novi studijski album, ali i prvi solistički koncert u pulskoj Areni, koji će se održati u ponedjeljak, 8. kolovoza. Pjesma ""Dani i godine” osvaja na prvo slušanje, a Nina ostaje vjerna pop i soul izričaju s kojim osvaja publiku već dva desetljeća. Glazbu i tekst potpisuje autorski dvojac Nina Badrić i Predrag Martinjak. 

“Pjesma ""Dani i godine” nastala je u jednom dahu,a Nina je gospodarica emocija. Ustvari, ne pjeva ona već njezina duša. Reakcije naših suradnika su odlične. Pamtljiva je, zarazna i nosi iskrenu emociju, koju svi prepoznaju i respektiraju.“ - Predrag Martinjak.

Novu pjesmu „Dani i godine”, oni koji su je imali prilike čuti, već su  proglasili nasljednicom ""Čarobnog jutra"". Nova pjesma svoju će premijeru pred publikom imati na koncertu 8.8. u Areni Pula, a tom će prilikom ova lijepa glazbenica ispričati dvadesetogodišnju priču o uspjehu, u kojoj je naglasak bio i ostao na – pjesmi.",aquariusrecordshr,aquarius records Nina Badrić Dani i godine Nina Badric Darko Drinovac,Music,213

Lyrics:
Lost but marching on like we've always known the trail
Searching for our ending to the fairy-tale
Sometimes even shooting stars find wishes that miss their marks
But when the night gets too dark
And the road home seems too far

We'll see the sun come up again
We will climb higher than we've been
We got a fire that burns within
We are the Dragonhearted
We are the Dragonhearted
Courage to stop a cannonball
Together we stand 30 feet tall
We got a fire that burns within
We are the Dragonhearted
We are the Dragonhearted

We are the Dragonhearted

Fearless we soar, speeding arrows ricochet
Break free, our hearts burn brighter than yesterday
And through the battles we wage
When our shields fall away
The armor cracks and breaks
If ever our torches fade

We'll see the sun come up again
We will climb higher than we've been
We got a fire that burns within
We are the Dragonhearted
We are the Dragonhearted
Courage to stop a cannonball
Together we stand 30 feet tall
We got a fire that burns within
We are the Dragonhearted
We are the Dragonhearted

Oh, oh, oh, oh (x8)
We are the Dragonhearted

Standing tall, forever united
We are the Dragonhearted
We are the Dragonhearted
We are the Dragonhearted

Oh, oh, oh, oh (x8)

Who can say where the road goes, 
Where the day flows, only time? 
And who can say if your love grows, 
As your heart chose, only time? 

Who can say why your heart sighs, 
As your live flies, only time? 
And who can say why your heart cries 
when your love lies, only time? 

Who can say when the roads meet, 
That love might be, in your heart? 
and who can say when the day sleeps, 
and the night keeps all your heart? 
Night keeps all your heart..... 

Who can say if your love grows, 
As your heart chose, only time? 
And who can say where the road goes 
Where the day flows, only time? 

Who knows? Only time 
Who knows? Only time

Sunshine it is shining grey

And I wish I could dig straight down
Black it all away
But in the dark there’s still a sound
And nothing changed

[Chorus]
Don’t know if I have ever heard you sing but I hear it
Hear it, hear it, hear it, hear it,
Don’t know if I have ever held your hand but I seek it
Seek it, seek it, seek it, seek it
Don’t know if I have ever loved but I feel it
Put the puzzle back together see what I’m dreaming
When I find the pieces

Don’t know if I have ever loved but I feel it
Put the puzzle back together see what I’m dreaming
When I find the pieces

Faces echo with no names
Strangers feel like home but fade

Fellow armsmen, I ask you,
Will you follow me tonight to break their spine,
And reclaim what once was mine?
Those cravens.

Backstabbed me, deceived me,
Never shall I tolerate their crimes again,
Now let the hunt begin.

7000 souls, scared and daunted, such tale of woe,
Not too long ago, this village was a golden 
scene of hope.

Call down the reckoning,
To bring back hope and peace,
Restore our gloria,
To live forever.

Bring down the dark regime,
I know how to unleash eternal power,
Lead us to order,
I am the Lightbringer!

Fellow warriors, I ask you,
Should my campaign come to an end?
There's way more to avenge.

15 million souls,
Living in this realm without much hope,
Not too long ago, this kingdom was a golden 
state of hope.

For a little bit better sound quality.

And if you got Bel Air'd...lol at you!

*I do not own the rights to this song*


The real Fresh Prince theme.

Now, this is a story all about how
My life got flipped-turned upside down
And I'd like to take a minute
Just sit right there
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air

In west Philadelphia born and raised
On the playground was where I spent most of my days
Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool
And all shootin some b-ball outside of the school
When a couple of guys
Who were up to no good
Startin making trouble in my neighborhood
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
And said 'You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air'

I begged and pleaded with her day after day
But she packed my suitcase and send me on my way
She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket.
I put my walkman on and said, 'I might as well kick it'.

First class, yo this is bad
Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass.
Is this what the people of Bel-Air Living like?
Hmmmmm this might be alright.

But wait I hear there're prissy, bourgeois and all that
Is this the type of place that they should send this cool cat?
I don't think so
I'll see when I get there
I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air

Well, the plane landed and when I came out
There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out
I ain't trying to get arrested yet
I just got here
I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared

I whistled for a cab and when it came near
The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror
If anything I can say that this cab was rare
But I thought 'Nah forget it' - 'Yo homes to Bel Air'

I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8
And I yelled to the cabbie 'Yo homes smell ya later'
I looked at my kingdom
I was finally there
To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air",Vissor,Fresh Prince Bel Air Theme Song Intro Music,Music,178

Lyrics:
--------------------
Do we fight to hold our heads up high,
And beat the drum to what we love?

Risk the fall, oh we have felt it all,
come crashing down from far above.

Stars arising, countless worlds colliding,
only one will take it all.
 
Can we bring to fall the giants,
Can we make the final call.

We are the ones,
To ignite the darkened skies.

The champions,
Of a world that we defy.

A solemn reign,
Of the few who rise up high.

And we all fight,
at the last light.

Hearing voices from afar,
join the madness when the curtain falls.

Risk it all, hold nothing back,
Seize the day, we must attack.

Stars arising, countless worlds colliding,
only one will take it all.

Can we bring to fall the giants,
Can we make the final call.

We are the ones,
To ignite the darkened skies.

The champions,
Of a world that we defy.

A solemn reign,
Of the few who rise up high.

And we all fight,
at the last light.

Can we bring to fall the giants.

We are the ones,
To ignite the darkened skies.

The champions,
Of a world that we defy.

A solemn reign,
Of the few who rise up high.

And we all fight,
at the last light.",League of Legends,Riot Games Riot League of Legends League LoL MOBA ARTS RTS,Gaming,216

LYRICS:

There's Hydrogen and Helium
Then Lithium, Beryllium
Boron, Carbon everywhere
Nitrogen all through the air

With Oxygen so you can breathe
And Fluorine for your pretty teeth
Neon to light up the signs
Sodium for salty times

Magnesium, Aluminium, Silicon
Phosphorus, then Sulfur, Chlorine and Argon
Potassium, and Calcium so you'll grow strong
Scandium, Titanium, Vanadium and Chromium and Manganese

CHORUS
This is the Periodic Table
Noble gas is stable
Halogens and Alkali react agressively
Each period will see new outer shells
While electrons are added moving to the right

Iron is the 26th
Then Cobalt, Nickel coins you get
Copper, Zinc and Gallium
Germanium and Arsenic

Selenium and Bromine film
While Krypton helps light up your room
Rubidium and Strontium then Yttrium, Zirconium

Niobium, Molybdenum, Technetium
Ruthenium, Rhodium, Palladium
Silver-ware then Cadmium and Indium
Tin-cans, Antimony then Tellurium and Iodine and Xenon and then Caesium and...

Barium is 56 and this is where the table splits
Where Lanthanides have just begun
Lanthanum, Cerium and Praseodymium

Neodymium's next too
Promethium, then 62's
Samarium, Europium, Gadolinium and Terbium
Dysprosium, Holmium, Erbium, Thulium
Ytterbium, Lutetium

Hafnium, Tantalum, Tungsten then we're on to
Rhenium, Osmium and Iridium
Platinum, Gold to make you rich till you grow old
Mercury to tell you when it's really cold

Thallium and Lead then Bismuth for your tummy
Polonium, Astatine would not be yummy
Radon, Francium will last a little time
Radium then Actinides at 89

REPEAT CHORUS

[Lyrics]

Do you remember feeling invincible?
When there was trouble it was us against the world
We kept running, running through the night
Chasing the sun 'til anything felt right

Can you save me now?
I get lost up in the clouds
Can you save me now?
You were my gravity
Can you save me now?
When the ground drops out I get lost in the clouds
Save me now
You were my gravity
Now my world is shattering

Ooooh, you were my gravity
Ooooh, you were my gravity

You left me out there with no one but myself
In an open field for the lightning to strike me down
I was the moon, you were the sun
I can't seem to shine now that you're gone
Now I'm out of orbit cause you left without warning
Are you somewhere better now?

Can you save me now?
I get lost up in the clouds
Can you save me now?
You were my gravity
Can you save me now?
When the ground drops out I get lost in the clouds
Save me now
You were my gravity
Now my world is shattering

Ooooh, you were my gravity
Ooooh, you were my gravity

When you went away, thought I'd never be the same
Would the nightmare ever end?
If I could do it again I wouldn't change a thing 'cause it's made me who I am

And now I'm shattering

Can you save me now?
When the ground drops out I get lost up in the clouds
Save me now
You were my gravity
Can you save me now?
When the ground drops out I get lost up in the clouds
Save me now
You were my gravity
Now my world is shattering

Ooooh, now my world is shattering
Ooooh, you were my gravity

327,25000,30381736,448086,The Curse of the Sad Mummy | Amumu Music Video - League of Legends,"Every child in Valoran has heard the tale before,
About the cursed mummy boy who felt his heart no more.

Unravel the fable of Amumu, the Sad Mummy, here: http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/creative-spotlight/curse-sad-mummy

Lyrics:
Every child in Valoran has heard the tale before,
About the cursed mummy boy who felt his heart no more.
So sad and lorn, the helpless lad, Amumu was his name,
He ventured out to find a friend and learn about his bane.

For many years, young Amumu traveled through the lands,
Determined to make friends, if only they would understand,
But even when Amumu stood upon the ledge of home,
His hope would disappoint him, and he would remain alone.

But then the curse began to whisper in his ear,
And would confirm what was Amumu’s biggest fear,
It pledged that never shall someone become his friend,
It pledged that he shall be alone until his end.

The sorrow and despair,
Became too much to bear.

The moment when Amumu realized what he had done,
Too late it was, for him, for them, the evil curse had won.
The anger and the anguish overwhelmed his fragile soul,
And caused a wicked tantrum that he never could control.

Prije tebe život moj
Pucanj bija je u prazno
I sve druge ne stanu 
Ni u rubriku  ""pod razno""
Tvoji otisci su tu
Na mome srcu ka' na čaši
Prava jubav nikad ne promaši

Skupa smo se smijali
Skupa plakali bez stida
Sad san ka' i vojnik ja 
Koji epolete skida

I znan da nisan svetac 
i znan da iman miljun mana
Al' te volin ...Sve do zadnjeg dana

KO ĆE NEGO JA
MOJE ZLATO JUBIT
OĆU DA SE ZNA,EJ DA SE ZNA 
DA VOLIN TE JOŠ
VOLIN ZAPOLUDIT

Kunen ti se jednu stvar
Gori nisan moga bit
Dok me nisi dotakla 
Ja san bija gluv i slip

Jer ništa mi nije od nas važnije....

Stihovi:

Šta se ovo majko moja sa mnom dogodi,
slomilo se sve u meni grom me pogodi.
Kao da sam lutka koja bol ne osjeća,
ostavi me ljubav moja usred proljeća...

Preko polja za mnom idu dvije muzike.
Jedna uvijek tugu svira da me ubije,
druga samo jednu pjesmu, pjesmu ljubavi,
pjesmu koju neću moći ja preboljeti...

Oprosti mi što te volim, Bog me kaznio,
dao mi je da te vidim, pa te uzeo.
A u mome srcu samo teku otrovi,
u njima me nema više u njima si ti...

Pustio sam jednu suzu mušku najtežu,
pustio i sa njom dušu, dušu ranjenu.",Frano Kiso,željko bebek oprosti mi što te volim tekst lyrics album stihovi bijelo dugme rock,Music,294

TEKST PJESME

knjigu piše vitez roda moga
u dalekoj zemlji okovan,
pa je šalje svojoj vjernoj ljubi
pod zidine grada bijeloga

ej, ljube moja, moga oka vilo
idu dani, ode godina
ej, da uz’ame nije tvoje tilo
i da su me braća izdala

sude mi, 
zato što svoje volim,
volim najviše
što sam branio moje najdraže

sude mi, 
dušmani, moja ljube
ali ne znaju
da je istina voda duboka

ej, djeco mila, vite grane moje
poslušajte što vam govorim
ej, 'ko ne ljubi i ne čuva svoje
Božjeg lica neće vidjeti

Lyrics:
This sinking feeling sets,
It feels just like a hole inside your chest.
I know you're thinking,
No, no, no, no, it is easier said than done,
But please let me attest.
I know it's hard.
You're feeling like you're trapped,
But that's how you react,
When you cannot see the light.
But try and see the light.
I'm tellin' you,
No, no, no, no,
You're the only one
Standing in your way,
Just take a breath, relax, and tell me…

Why?
Please tell me why do we worry?
Why?
Why do we worry at all?
Why?
Just tell me why do we worry?
When worry is never helping tell me why worry at all?

Why do we insist,
On crossing bridges that do not exist?
Let's take these issues
Step by step by step, to work it out,
Day by day by day we're falling down,
But life goes on.
I've got some questions,
Are you sick of feelin' sorry?
Uh huh,
And people sayin' not to worry?
Uh huh,
Sick of hearing this hakuna matata motto,
From people who won the lotto,
We're not that lucky.
Have you noticed that you're breathing?
Uh huh,
Look around and count your blessings,
Uh huh,
So when you're sick of all this stressin' and guessin' I'm suggestin' you turn this up and let them hear you sing it.

Chin up, quit actin' like you're half dead.
Tears can only half fill how you’re feelin'.
Don't worry, be happy baby.
Stand up, life is too damn short,
That clock is ticking.
Man up, if ya feel me,
Everybody sing it.

Short summary of the story. The woman sees doom coming so she prepares. The man thinks she's getting kind of crazy from her old age. The doom stuff happens and he realizes she was right. They end up in the tower and see a photo of themselves with their son Steve (from cubeland) holding his pig. You realize they are in hardcore mode, so once they pass away the old world is deleted and a new world is made. They are young again because they have to start over.

Lyrics:
(verse 1) 
Yesterday it rained 
Watched everything wash away 
It took some time to dry 
Before I could feel okay 

I used all my tools 
Foundation of clay 
You kept digging this hole 
But climbing's not my forte 

(pre-chorus) 
Take what you need 
We can fight our enemies 
But we have to hurry before 
the world crumbles around us 

(chorus) 
Take my hand 
We can build a land from the ground up 
I don't even mind 
leaving it behind us 
Watch and wait and work until it all falls down 

(verse 2) 
Today the sky fell 
Clouds in disarray 
I put back all the blue 
Before the sun could complain 

There were stars everywhere 
Zombies at my gate 
Now that the end is near 
Nothing left to do but wait 

(pre-chorus 2) 
Are we prepared? 
Are we there? 
Do you even care 
Now I am afraid, but it's okay 
The world crumbles around us

Lyrics:
Na pijaci sam jučer prod’o
Kravu i traktor
Da mogu da se prijavim
Na onaj X-faktor
Zbogom poljoprivredi
Kajmaku i palenti
Odoh i ja majko
Tamo gdje su talenti
Zaboraviću štale
I domaću hranu
Sad će raja da me gleda
Na malom ekranu
A cijenjeni će žiri
Prepoznat’ vrlo vješto
Da imam neku žicu
Da imam ono nešto
(Ja imam ono nešto) 

Rekao sam zbogom
Zemljoradničkim mukama
Od mikrofona neću dobit’
Žuljeve na rukama
Na estradnom nebu
Svima sunce sija
Kad zvijezda možeš biti ti,
Što ne bi mog’o i ja?
Preseliću se u grad
Živjeću u stanu
Gledaće me cijela bosna
Na svakom kanalu
A cijenjeni će žiri
Prepoznat’ vrlo vješto
Da imam neku žicu
Da imam ono nešto
(Ja imam ono nešto) 

Nemoj mala plakati
Niti za mnom žaliti
Neću ti se vratiti
Odo’ u rijaliti

O, o, odo’ u rijaliti

Ne treba vam stranka
Ni omiljena partija
Glasajte za mene
To je demokratija
S jednim sms-om
Ti mi omogući 
Da i moje lice poznato ti zvuči
Postaću ja popularan
Nikad nije kasno
Sa tv-a pozdravljaću
Svoje selo glasno
Maksuz selam rodbini
I svima što me znaju
Hej Bosno, Bosno, rodni kraju

O, o, odo’ u rijaliti

U svakom rijalitiju
Ja bih dobro proš’o
Al’ na farmu ne idem,
Otamo sam doš’o

- STIHOVI -
Ljubav ima lipih riči, da bar zna san jednu reć
Lipa rič da te izliči, ne bi mogla ti uteć
Da si samo tija čuti šta ti šapće srca glas
Ti me nikad ne bi pusti' i još imali bi nas

Kad te sretnem još te gledam
Da ne vidiš, ispod oka
Još je rana uvik friška
Još je rana preduboka

Kad te vidim još te gledam
Još te ima svud u meni
Još te drugom nikom ne dam

SOLO

Tekst:
Možda, možda si ti za mene
ja možda nisam za tebe
pazi na sebe!

Pijem, smijem se pa bi plako
sa mnom je tako svaku noć
zovem u pomoć!

Ajde digni level sreće 
da obiljezimo veče
samo jako jako ili nikako

Ajde prekid me ne boli
uvijek ne'ko nekog voli
meni dobro bit će 
a on patit će.

Solo sam, solo sam ja
vide svi da solo sam, solo sam ja
udaram po piću, nove zore sviću.

Solo sam, solo sam ja,
ide mi jer solo sam solo sam ja
mogu sve što hoću i danju i noću.

Hajdee

Mi popit cemo sve ove noći 
Daj daj daj daj daj daj daj
što toči se i što se ne toči
daj daj daj daj daj daj daj 

Naša ljubav uvijek k'o balon prsne
pukne i gotovo
Al te tvoje usne, proklete usne
ma hoću te ponovo.

Možda, možda si ti za mene
ja možda nisam za tebe , pazi ne sebe!

Devet, prošlo je devet dana
krevet mi slaba strana sad
ne spavam gori grad,

Malo vatra-malo voda
malo kupi-malo proda
malo hoce-neće 
sve mi uzet će.

Malo crvenoga ruža,
uzmi sve što života pruža
pamet stani kaže,
al srce ne laže.

Ivan Zak - Naučila si me

Naučila si me kako treba u životu
da uvijek platim skupo svu ljepotu
izgubio sam te nisam znao ranije
da se gubi uvijek sto je najdraže

Samo ne daj nikome da sazna
da sam tebi bio kazna
da sam tebi bio samo sve najgore

Izgubio sam te k´o zima jesen
a sa tobom bio sam zanesen
dal' te onaj sto te ima
bar zaslužio il' kao ja rastužio

Naučila si me da ne treba voljeti
ako ne možeš preboljeti
izgubio sam te, nisam znao ranije
da se gubi uvijek sto je najdraže

Samo ne daj nikome da sazna
da sam tebi bio kazna
da sam tebi bio samo sve najgore

Izgubio sam te k´o zima jesen
a sa tobom bio sam zanesen
dal' te onaj sto te ima

374,2400,15681335,60239,"Eminem - Sing For The Moment [Uncensored, HD] + Lyrics","(ft. Steven Tyler & Joe Perry) Official Music Video
Album: The Eminem Show (2002)
Label: Shady, Aftermath, Interscope
Producer(s): Eminem, J. Bass

[Verse 1]
These ideas are nightmares to white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing, it's so scary in a house that allows
no swearing
To see him walking around with his headphones blaring
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care
He's a problem child
And what bothers him all comes out, when he talks about
His fuckin' dad walkin' out
Cause he just hates him so bad that he blocks him out
If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are whacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back
Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants, do-rags and a stocking cap
His step-father hit him, so he socked him back, and broke his nose
His house is a broken home, there's no control, he just let's his emotions
go...

[Chorus]
{C'mon}, sing with me, {sing}, sing for the years
{Sing it}, sing for the laughter, sing for the tears, {c'mon)
Sing it with me, just for today, maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you
away...

[Verse 2]
Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangsta's
In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun, lonely cause don't anyone know me
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate, I guess words are a
mothafucka they can be great
Or they can degrade, or even worse they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass
But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get they hands on every dime you have, they want you to lose your mind
every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me, strictly just to get me off
of these streets quickly
But all they kids be listenin' to me religiously, so i'm signin' cd's while
police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter but his grudge is against me
If i'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense Pete
It's all political, if my music is literal, and i'm a criminal how the fuck
can I raise a little girl
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to, you're full of shit too, Guerrera, that
was a fist that hit you...

[CHORUS]

[Verse 3]
They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well can it load a gun up for you , and cock it too
Well if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault and i'll get sued
See what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
And they want to get one cause they think the shit's cool
Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves, we entertainers
Of course the shit's affectin' our sales, you ignoramus
But music is reflection of self, we just explain it, and then we get our
checks in the mail
It's fucked up ain't it
How we can come from practically nothing to being able to have any fuckin'
thing that we wanted
That's why we sing for these kids, who don't have a thing
Except for a dream, and a fuckin' rap magazine
Who post pin-up pictures on their walls all day long
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in their lives
Till they sit and they cry at night wishin' they'd die
Till they throw on a rap record and they sit, and they vibe
We're nothin' to you but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes
That's why we seize the moment try to freeze it and own it, squeeze it and
hold it
Cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone
Just let our spirits live on, through our lyrics that you hear in our
songs and we can...

LYRICS
Black. Dirty Teeth. In The Crease. Was the proof too good to be believed?
It’s The Cunt. With The Tongue. Who belongs on broken knees.
So far, it occurs to me that everybody in the world is afraid of me
Just one more sin and down we go. But the news is out, and I think I’m going to
Kill Myself. Fuck Myself. Or Tell Myself. About the only thing that matters now.
We Bury What We Fear The Most- Approaching Original Violence.
Is the Silence where you hide it? ‘Cause I don’t recognize you anymore.
To Each His Own… Life can do with one less watered-down excuse.
…If this is over, you can tell me it’s no use.
USE- JUST TELL ME IT’S OVER

Today, We Will Deceive Our Better Selves into assimilating pain from something else
Put On Your Face And Show Me Why Behind The Scenes We Had To Simply Comply
Now, the Community doesn’t feel any better than it used to be
I want to be a judge in a criminal case- you covered up, did you cultivate?
Be Yourself. Not Yourself. Know Yourself. ‘Cause no one seems to know you now.
We Carry What We Can’t Control- Approaching Original Violence.
In The Silence, there’s a Nihilist… who doesn’t care, and never did.
To Each His Own… Life can do with one less watered-down excuse.
…There comes a time when we can’t take the same abuse.
…If this is over, you can tell me it’s no use… USE

Drug Out, Pissed On, Everything’s The Same
Bitch and Moan, It doesn’t matter, nothing’s going to change
I don’t want to watch another brother fucking die- so discarded, fallen by the side
-Don’t tell me it’s the only way- just another reason why you never take the bait.
The trials, the scheming, the Burden of the Beast
Both Your Faces Turn Your Back On Everything You Fought To Save A Dream
Now that it’s over… when this is over…

We Are The Angels’ Fear To Tread. Approaching Original Violence.
We’re The Silence. We’ll Deny It. We can’t continue on like this.
To Each His Own… Life can do with one less watered-down excuse.
…There comes a time when we can’t take the same abuse.
My God, it would’ve taken just one word to stay from you.
Now that this is over, you can tell me it’s no use… 
Now that this is over, you can tell me it’s no use…
USE- JUST TELL ME IT’S OVER
It doesn’t matter what you say. It doesn’t matter what you do.
We can’t continue on like this.",Slipknot,Slipknot (Musical Group) AOV .5: The Gray Chapter Corey Taylor Lyrics Audio Roadrunner Records (Record Label),Music,333

▶️ Lyrics:

Legends Never Die when the world is calling you
Can you hear them screaming out your name?
Legends Never Die they become a part of you
Every time you bleed for reaching greatness 
Relentless you survive

They never lose hope when everything's cold and the fighting's near
It's deep in their bones they’ll run into smoke when the fire is fierce
'Oh pick yourself up, ‘cause

Legends Never Die when the world is calling you
Can you hear them screaming out your name?
Legends Never Die they become a part of you
Every time you bleed for reaching greatness 
Legends Never Die

They're written down in eternity
But you'll never see the price it costs, the scars collected all their lives

When everything’s lost, they pick up their hearts and avenge defeat
Before it all starts, they suffer through harm just to touch a dream
'Oh pick yourself up, ‘cause

Legends Never Die when the world is calling you
Can you hear them screaming out your name?
Legends Never Die they become a part of you
Every time you bleed for reaching greatness 
Legends Never Die

When the world is calling out your name
Begging you to fight
Pick yourself up once more
Pick yourself up, ‘cause

Legends Never Die when the world is calling you
Can you hear them screaming out your name?
Legends Never Die they become a part of you
Every time you bleed for reaching greatness 
Legends Never Die

KREATIVNA AGENCIJA d.o.o. koji su radili svaki video spot Dječaka, pa i ovaj, kažu slijedeće. ""Video je najkompliciraniji spot Dječaka i najveći produkcijski poduhvat dosad, jer je zahtjevao pronalaženje hrpe lokacija i likova ekvivalentnih snimanju jednog omanjeg filma, koje je trebalo usnimiti da bi se 7 priča iz pjesme doslovno prenijelo u stvarnost. Da nam cijeli proces ne bude prelagan, odlučili smo si uvesti i numerološko ograničenje i svaku od tih 7 priča ispričati u točno 7 kadrova. Video znači doslovno prati radnju pjesme. Razni ljudi u Splitu donesu određene pogrešne odluke koje ih dovedu do našeg Hladnjača diska u Lovrincu gdje ih zlatni bog gitare isprati pod zemlju na posljednje počivalište i brzi zaborav. To nisu zombiji, to su mrtvi ljudi na putu do zaborava.

Veliko hvala prvenstveno glavnom pokrovitelju -- tportalu, zatim Airsoft klubu Split na oružju, Hotelu Park na fotelji i viskiju, Caffeu Vidilica na negro fotelji i lampi, trafici na Spinutu, Nelinom bratu na negro ganxta BMW-u, dvije Ivine babe na dva stana za snimanje i šminkericama Dobra vila na finoj šminci. Hvala svima koji su nam pomagali tokom snimanja, Studiu Baranda, Marinu Mariniju, Lil' Maji koja je bila duh pa smo ju izbacili, još nekim ljudima na odjeći i gitari.

Hvala svim glumcima po poretku pojavljivanja u spotu: Krešo, Pavica, Frane, Sanela, Predsjednik, Blaž, Petar, Hudara, Aldo, Tonči, VRH, Toni, Antonio, Pera, Čuba, Branka, Karilo, Milito.

Bez vas ovaj video ne bi bio moguć!""

Tekst:

(SETT)
Preko tjedna gospoda, a vikendom smo gamad
Gutamo tu gudrovinu kao neki šaman
-
Od kluba do kluba, od rejva do rejva
Brate, samo loudam, malo toga sejvam
-
Gutanje, gudranje, onda bubanje, pumpanje
Onda lizanje, dudlanje, onda tucanje pa kljucanje
- 
Ne znam kog' sam jebo niti dal' sam jebo nju il' njega
Nije bitno brate, treba samo jebat, jebat, jebat
- 
Krvarim iz nozdrva, možda sam se tuk'o
Bijelo ispod nosa, možda sam previše vuk'o
-
Budim se u tuđoj kući, ponekad garaži
Budim se u autu, u parku il' na plaži
-
A nekad se ne probudim neg' jednostavno umrem
Uskrsnem dan kasnije, mamuran k'o đubre
-
Odem ispod tuša da se operem od smrti
Onda nazad do tog kluba gdje mi DJ gaber vrti

REFREN

Nisam gay, al DJ jebi me u glavu (x4)

(3KI STIL)
Čujem da večeras ima dobar party u gradu
Pušta disko džokej koji vrti rejv po Novom Sadu
-
Kažu da je dobar i da pušta samo dobar gaber
Dolazimo ja i frend i njegov spaljeni burazer
-
Bit će droge, bit će svega, diler nam je moj kolega
Koji izaš'o je iz zatvora ima dva-tri tjedna
-
Odma roknem jedan ekser, ljubim ljude oko sebe
Jer sam vesel, daj mi samo rejva jer me gudra trese
-
Kad ponese dobar ritam kao luđak glavom gibam
Uzmem mobitel u ruke počnem dobre pičke slikat'
-
Dečki jedu govna jer misle da ih barim
Al' ne kuže da sam to već jeb'o, brate, prošli parti
-
DJ vrti ploču ja prstenjačim na floru
Neku ribu koje ljetos sam upozno na moru
-
Samo ljubav oko mene, volim drogu, volim žene
Nisam derpe, ali volim kad DJ dobro jebe

REFREN

(3KI STIL)
Daj mi samo gudre, pa makar brate umrem
Ako nema para za drogu dat ću dupe
-
Dragi moj DJ-u, zavrti meni gaber
To je tako dobro, ko senf i safalade

(SETT)
Yo! Kada brate umrem, na grobu nek' mi plešu
Neka DJ pušta jungle dok se uplakani krešu
-
Bože uzmi ISIS, koleru i sušu
I vrati DJ Bobu, Scootera, Marushu

Molimo ne kopirati videospot i pjesmu. U protivnom, svaku neovlaštenu kopiju bit ćemo primorani ukloniti.

Aranžman pjesme „Duguješ mi ljeto"" potpisuju Ivan Zak i Miljenko Pušić, dok je ista snimana u studiju Titanic. Igor Vignjević, s kojim Ivan prvi put surađuje, redatelj je video spota nove pjesme. Prekrasni ljetni prikazi u spotu snimani su na području Omiša, Šibenika i okružju šibenskih otoka, te Splita i splitskog Hemigway bara. 
Zarazna glazba i stihovi koje još jednom potpisuje Ivan Zak obećavaju pravi ljetni hit koji će osvojiti publiku i klubove.

Kažeš mi, sačekaj, doći ću do stana,
al meni čekanje nije jača strana,
meni je bez tebe sat k'o milijun dana.
Ma znam ja nisi ti tamo gdje mi kažeš,
jedini posao tvoj je da me lažeš,
haljine kupujes meni, a s druge ih skidaš.
Najbolji ti si u tome da nekoga izdaš.

Ali se prokleto dobro ljubiš,
uvijek te hoću sve više i više,
ti čim me vidiš vrijeme ne gubiš,
krv mi poludi i teško se diše,
Da si moj bol, piše u očima tvojim,
al se ne bojim
jer ti se prokleto dobro ljubiš,
na usnama ja ti najbolje stojim,
najbolje stojim

Kažeš mi, sačekaj, što se uvijek pališ,
ne znaš ti šta je to kada ženi fališ,
kada se proklinje noć,
kad piješ i žališ.
Ma znam ja nisi ti tamo gdje mi kažeš,

Begini - Napala me s leđa (lyrics)

Napala me s leđa 
pa me još i vrijeđa
Kaže mi da nisam neki kavalir
Samo nek me vrijeđa
Mene to ne smeta
Smeta me što nisam njezin odabir

Čudna noć
Opet vidim je u gradu
Kao nekad meni,
drugom daje nadu

Čudna noć
Ona opet gradom s drugim šeće
A vidim da se još
Za mnom okreće

Napala me s leđa
Pa me još i vrijeđa
Kaže mi da nisam neki kavalir
Samo nek me vrijeđa
Mene to ne smeta
Smeta me što nisam njezin odabir

Čudna mala
A ja opet k'o budala
Svaki dan bi ona drugog
Svojim zvala

Samo da me opet 
Napravi još ludim
Znam ja dobro
Da je takva 
Pa se i ne čudim

Napala me s leđa...

TEKST PJESME:
 
kakvo je to došlo vrijeme i brat brata vara
što nam rade loše sluge loših gospodara
svaka laž je trn u kruni mojih predaka
a gdje je istina

nema riječi, nema dara, niti pjesama
da sakriju moju muku, moja sjećanja
zlato daje, dušu krade, slatko progovara
guja iz njedara

'ko to moje ime doziva
čudni ljudi, čudnog imena
pa mi kunu, što je svetinja
vjera, ljubav i domovina

na sve strane dižu glave ptice rugalice
sve je manje sretnih dana, sloge i pravice
a najbolji među nama noću vodu piju
bijelo lice kriju

'ko to moje ime doziva
čudni ljudi, čudnog imena
pa mi kunu, što je svetinja
vjera, ljubav i domovina

Lyrics: JEDNA JE NOĆ

Ne smeta to što si s njom
jer nije dom gdje je dom
dom je gdje srce je tvoje
na mene padaš
gineš zbog ljubavi moje

Koliko jaka sam znam
tek kada vas ugledam
ruka na ramenu tvome
dok točiš joj piće
moji te pogledi lome

Kradem što je već moje
i usne nam se u mislima spoje

Jedna je noć 
dovoljna da meni se vratiš
i istinu da shvatiš
dok stojiš s njom
piće za pićem dok piješ
k'o da suze kriješ

Jer svi smo užasno slabi
na stare ljubavi svoje
i zato noćas me zgrabi
ljubi to što je tvoje

Ne smeta to što si s njom
ali me udari grom
kad glumi da je sve tvoje
a na mene padaš
gineš zbog ljubavi moje

Koliko jaka sam znam
tek kada vas ugledam
ruka na ramenu tvome
dok točiš joj piće
moji te pogledi lome

Kradem što je već moje
i usne nam se u mislima spoje

Jedna je noć...

In this INTERMEDIATE PIANO TUTORIAL version you can learn HOW TO PLAY All Star by Smash Mouth on piano! :)

🌟Fun fact: :D
All Star, but it's so beautiful and emotional I'm 100% Sure You will CRY! 
I Bet my KIDNEY you will cry! :D

🌟Lyrics:
Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an ""L"" on her forehead

Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now, wait till you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
My world's on fire, how about yours?
That's the way I like it and I never get bored

Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
All that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show, on get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars

Somebody once asked could I spare some change for gas?
I need to get myself away from this place
I said yep what a concept
I could use a little fuel myself
And we could all use a little change

Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go (go!)
You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

REFREN:
Nekad imala si (x2)
Moju ljubav...
Nekad imala si (x2)
Moju ljubav...
Al' ovaj kurac je zlo... (x4)

SETT:
Ja sam dobar čovjek, ali moj je kurac đavao
Odradio bi hipodrom pizdi ko Ivan Pavao,
-
Kad srce kaže ""da"", Zli kurac kaže ""jok""
Oće ručat pičetine i cugat' picin sok,
- 
Govori mi: ""Sette, zašto voziš Volvo?
Previše je dvosjeda koje nisi prob'o
- 
Zašto jedna pička, ak' ih možeš imat' sto?
Nabavi si Tinder, tamo ima pički gro
-
I na Fejsu i na Twitteru, pa čak i Google Plusu
Možeš naći kurvu koja kurcu dat će pusu
-
Da trebaš jednu pizdu onda sve bi bile iste
Ali nisu pa na svijetu imaš različite pizde
-
Imaš crne, imaš bijele, imaš dagnje imaš ruže
Imaš dlakave i obrijane, široke i uže
- 
Jesi prob'o sve? Ako nisi, onda moraš""
Hvala ti Zli kurče, ti mudre riječi šoraš!

REFREN

3KI STIL:
Odlučio sam čvrsto, neću masturbirat
Krenuo u crkvu, pa čak i ministrirat
-
Al' mi ne da mira, i to me baš živcira
Kurac mi je lud, neprestano erektira
-
Ne moram ga dirat, odjednom počne divljat
Vidim zgodnu malu pa se napalim ko svinja
-
Odmah krene znoj jer me napala vrućina
Zbog prekrasnih oblina počnem režat kao psina
-
Pa pizda li mu strin'na, šta to sa mnom ne štima
Možda bih se trebo savjetovat s doktorima
-
Možda je i klima, možda ljeto možda zima
Ja ipak mislim da je uzrok prokleta vagina
-
Ko nagazna mina, krivi korak - eksplodiram
3Ki Stil je glazbenik jer stalno kurcu svira
-
Nikada ne bira svaku ženu on pikira
Treba koloniju kurvi ko pjevačica Indira

Lyrics: 
Vadite me van, vadite iz ove sobe
Više nisam sam i ne rješavam ove probe
Nekad intelektulaci sad smo nezaposlanjaci
Tko će proć,a tko past maturu uuuuuuuuuu (kurac)

Ajajajjajajjaja
Čujem lako je.... zeka peka
Ajajjajajaja
Jesenski rok, čeka čeka

Zbog simploke, nema boda
Ne znam ništa osim svog bar koda
Bilo bi nam lijepo ljeto
Maturu sam riješio na sljepo
Padam ko iz vica, kao bez krila ptica

I iii ii i deklinacija, šteka šteka
Za Harjajajaajajaa Pottera, nema ljeka
Nema frke, šta će mi lova
Radit ću kao uzgajivač sova
Bilo bi nam ljepo ljeto
Maturu sam riješio na slijepo
Padam ko iz vica, kao od konzuma kolica

e ea ea a ea eea e ea ea a ea eeea (ma bolje b)

Na pitanje broj 3
Riješenje ne zana pola svijeta
Naučen sam na
Verse staročakavski poeta

Nekad 3 ribara u baci, sad su 4 (seljaci)
tko će dovest još nekoga aaaaaaa
ja ja ja ja ja ja 
dovodim sina da tjera ribe
ajajajaajajaa
goni se ti, komad mi ne gine

Nema ribe, nema soma
Od mature hvata me koma
Koji prsten nosi ona treba
U mojoj koči Hektorović vreba
