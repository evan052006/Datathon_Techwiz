# Datathon Techwiz

This repo holds all the code, and datasets used for Ristek Datathon. The development of the models can be seen in the Stockly notebook.
The models that were originally used and tested are the Linear Regression Model, Random Forest Model, XGBoost Model, and the LSTM Model.

The final model that were saved can be found in the hugging face link below:

## Using Linear Regression Model

The python script `inference-lr.py` can be run to see the prediction of what the stock price will be for the next day.

## Using LSTM Model

The python script `inference-lstm.py` can be run to see the prediction of what the stock price will be for the next day.
